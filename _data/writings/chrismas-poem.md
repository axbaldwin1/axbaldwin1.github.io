Twas the night before Christmas; you know what this means

The stockings, the presents, the candy, the dreams

Of all the young kids dreaming happy in bed.

“I hate it,” I mutter, with a sick sense of dread.

For the eve had arrived, and Christmas was next,

And I sat in my office and stared at my desk

All covered in invoices, payrolls and fluff

The bureaucracy needed to make useless stuff.

Working long hours for months at a time

In service of dopamine rushed to the mind

Of children who look forward to Christmas day

Cheap toys and small baubles to be thrown away.

My cell phone said five, but my day was not done,

This Christmas, my family would just eat alone

For I needed this job and I couldn’t just quit

There was one final pile of bullshit to ship.

So I stood from my desk and walked down to the floor

The factory buzzing with all of these poor

Souls still working, still packing, inspecting the lot

Why we were all here I honestly knew not.

Oh how I hate Christmas, the worst time of year

It brings me so much stress, not a teaspoon of cheer

Now August, that is the month that I crave

Mojitos on beaches, then go to a rave.

But to get to Vacation I have to survive

And distribute these presents by the end of the night

My manager comes up and says, with a sigh,

“It’s loaded”, he says, “come on Santa, let’s fly.”
