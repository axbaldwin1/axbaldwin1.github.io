# Corn Dogs

To tell a tale so silly I cannot resort to prose

So I will try some poetry; we’ll see where this shit goes.

This story is about a boy who’s ugly, dumb and fat,

And a sinister event one night which threw his life off track.

On Saturday, his folks took him to six flags for the day,

So he could run around, burn off some energy, and play.

But Kyle (that was this kid’s name) just ranted and complained,

And made his parents miserable, their nerves and marriage strained.

The one thing that would calm him was to stuff him full of food,

The parents oft resorted to this, even though they should

Not give him fat and grease and sugar; yet, it brought them peace

and so they bought him corn dogs, and just let him sit and eat.

Later that night he showered, brushed his teeth, and went to sleep,

When he noticed clothes covered in grease and ketchup on his sheets,

He opened up the closet, tossed his clothes down on the floor,

And said “boy I sure love corn dogs” while he wished that he had more.

You may not believe in miracles, but I tell you they occur,

For when he said “I love corn dogs” it seemed like some spirit heard,

And look down on Kyle with favor, granting his wish that night,

For a corn dog flew out of the closet and into his life.

He quickly grabbed the corn dog and took an enormous bite,

A couple packs of mustard also flew into his sight,

It was better than the six flags corn dog, better than a cake,

It was the most amazing fucking corndog anyone could taste.

Like rats who pilfer new York pizza or seagulls with fries,

Kyle scurried back to bed and soon devoured his whole prize.

The he fell asleep all full and happy, thinking nothing more

Of the miracle that happened at the open closet door.

The next day his parents yelled at him for crumbs that they had seen

And demanded that he clean his room and make his laundry clean.

As he stripped his bed and went towards the closet to collect

His dirty laundry, his two brain cells started to connect.

A spark went through his sluggish mind, a sly grin on his face

As he opened up the closet door, then stepped back just a pace

And forgetting dirty sheets he said “I love corn dogs” again

Behold! A corndog flew out of the closet once again.

From then on every night he had a corndog, two, or three,

For the miracle kept happening with increased frequency.

Fortunately the boy was dumb, and for weeks did not think

To ask for more than corndogs, and the odd soda drink.

But two weeks later, fat and happy, Kyle wanted more

He saw a Lamborghini on the internet, and sore

Of being mocked in class because his meanness and his size

He assumed that getting rich would make him cool in his friend’s eyes.

So he opened up the closet as to say the magic words

But this time when he spoke a timid tremor could be heard

Uncertain of success he spoke into the dark within

“Boy I love a million dollars” he said with uncertain grin.

For a moment nothing happened, then the moment stretched to three

And Kyle started believing that only cordogs could be

Brought forth from the magic closet; but soon there was a crash

And thrown down upon the closet floor was a million dollars cash.

Kyle’s eyes began to glow and they opened up so wide

As the magnitude of what had happened slowly grew inside.

He went to bed a little scared; maybe this was too far?

But when morning came he took the cash and went to buy a car.

He expected to pull up to school with Laborghini hot

And be surrounded by admirers; but his hopes were shot

You see, Kyle was fourteen years old and couldn’t even drive

The dealership just laughed and would not let him sit inside.

When he showed them all the money and said he got it all himself

The salesman took a step back and called his manager for help

Kyle overheard the word “police” and decided to run away

He’d rather not be arrested; he could try another day.

For the next week Kyle sulked, all his plans seemed to be shot

The cash stuffed in his dresser, for he knew that he could not

Show anyone his fortune out of fear that they’d ask “how?”

All he did was eat more corndogs and lay around just like a cow.

One evening he had a thought, another plan began to form

What else could make him cool in school? He rememberd Jason Horn

Bragging about having a girlfriend who lived two towns away

“Maybe I can get a girlfriend!” Kyle started right away.

He took a shower, shaved his peach fuzz, ran comb throughout his hair,

Put on his favorite polo shirt, and then he just stood there

In front of his dark closet, wondering if he really had

It in him to get a girlfriend; also, wouldn’t this be “bad”?

With corndogs and cash he didn’t share a second’s though of guilt

He assumed that it was magic, but a girl could not be built

Out of batter oil and sausages; would it be someone from school?

If the closet kidnapped his friend Emily, would that be cruel?

But his guilt quickly subsided; all he had to do was try,

After all, nothing bad had ever happened any other time.

So he stood at darkened closet and said “boy I love a girl

Who will be my girlfriend” and he  stepped back just to see what would occur.

Thick smoke, white and sulphurous, began to creep along the floor

And a shadowy human shape slowly appeared in closet door

With nerves like rubber bands Kyle turned on his bedroom light

And before him stood a woman; he could not believe the sight!

She was beautiful, so stunning, tall and fit with luscious curves,

She was dressed in sexy lingerie; she didn’t say a word

But she looked a Kyle with sexy eyes, then lifted up her hand

And beckoned him towards her, then whispered to “come in”.

Kyle never talked to women, to be honest he was scared

So he stood for many moments unable to go there

But the woman stayed and smiled at him and tempted him inside

And he didn’t even notice that her smile was just a bit too wide.

He took a single step towards her, then another, three

And the woman’s wide seductive smile began to shine with glee

He stood before her in the closet, nervous, then looked up at

Her eyes, which seemed to be less human and more like a cat’s.

As Kyle passed the closet threshold the woman grinned wide

And Kyle saw three rows of teeth as sharp as kitchen knives

He panicked, now conflicted, as his horniness and fear

Fought battles in his brain; the smile seemed more like a leer.

The woman looked down at him, saliva began to drip

Out of her mouth. Kyle turned, but too bad he wasn’t quick

Enough to run away; behind him slammed the closet door

And Kyle, corndog lover, was unfortunately no more.

Kyle’s parents never found him, they were horribly distressed

And some demon had a tasty meal on corndog-fattened flesh.

Is there a moral to this story? Some lesson that we could take?

Fuck if I know; I think tonight I’ll cook a tasty steak.
