          <h1>Corn Dogs</h1>
        </header>

        <p>To tell a tale so silly I cannot resort to prose</p>

<p>So I will try some poetry; we’ll see where this shit goes.</p>

<p>This story is about a boy who’s ugly, dumb and fat,</p>

<p>And a sinister event one night which threw his life off track.</p>

<p>On Saturday, his folks took him to six flags for the day,</p>

<p>So he could run around, burn off some energy, and play.</p>

<p>But Kyle (that was this kid’s name) just ranted and complained,</p>

<p>And made his parents miserable, their nerves and marriage strained.</p>

<p>The one thing that would calm him was to stuff him full of food,</p>

<p>The parents oft resorted to this, even though they should</p>

<p>Not give him fat and grease and sugar; yet, it brought them peace</p>

<p>and so they bought him corn dogs, and just let him sit and eat.</p>

<p>Later that night he showered, brushed his teeth, and went to sleep,</p>

<p>When he noticed clothes covered in grease and ketchup on his sheets,</p>

<p>He opened up the closet, tossed his clothes down on the floor,</p>

<p>And said “boy I sure love corn dogs” while he wished that he had more.</p>

<p>You may not believe in miracles, but I tell you they occur,</p>

<p>For when he said “I love corn dogs” it seemed like some spirit heard,</p>

<p>And look down on Kyle with favor, granting his wish that night,</p>

<p>For a corn dog flew out of the closet and into his life.</p>

<p>He quickly grabbed the corn dog and took an enormous bite,</p>

<p>A couple packs of mustard also flew into his sight,</p>

<p>It was better than the six flags corn dog, better than a cake,</p>

<p>It was the most amazing fucking corndog anyone could taste.</p>

<p>Like rats who pilfer new York pizza or seagulls with fries,</p>

<p>Kyle scurried back to bed and soon devoured his whole prize.</p>

<p>The he fell asleep all full and happy, thinking nothing more</p>

<p>Of the miracle that happened at the open closet door.</p>

<p>The next day his parents yelled at him for crumbs that they had seen</p>

<p>And demanded that he clean his room and make his laundry clean.</p>

<p>As he stripped his bed and went towards the closet to collect</p>

<p>His dirty laundry, his two brain cells started to connect.</p>

<p>A spark went through his sluggish mind, a sly grin on his face</p>

<p>As he opened up the closet door, then stepped back just a pace</p>

<p>And forgetting dirty sheets he said “I love corn dogs” again</p>

<p>Behold! A corndog flew out of the closet once again.</p>

<p>From then on every night he had a corndog, two, or three,</p>

<p>For the miracle kept happening with increased frequency.</p>

<p>Fortunately the boy was dumb, and for weeks did not think</p>

<p>To ask for more than corndogs, and the odd soda drink.</p>

<p>But two weeks later, fat and happy, Kyle wanted more</p>

<p>He saw a Lamborghini on the internet, and sore</p>

<p>Of being mocked in class because his meanness and his size</p>

<p>He assumed that getting rich would make him cool in his friend’s eyes.</p>

<p>So he opened up the closet as to say the magic words</p>

<p>But this time when he spoke a timid tremor could be heard</p>

<p>Uncertain of success he spoke into the dark within</p>

<p>“Boy I love a million dollars” he said with uncertain grin.</p>

<p>For a moment nothing happened, then the moment stretched to three</p>

<p>And Kyle started believing that only cordogs could be</p>

<p>Brought forth from the magic closet; but soon there was a crash</p>

<p>And thrown down upon the closet floor was a million dollars cash.</p>

<p>Kyle’s eyes began to glow and they opened up so wide</p>

<p>As the magnitude of what had happened slowly grew inside.</p>

<p>He went to bed a little scared; maybe this was too far?</p>

<p>But when morning came he took the cash and went to buy a car.</p>

<p>He expected to pull up to school with Laborghini hot</p>

<p>And be surrounded by admirers; but his hopes were shot</p>

<p>You see, Kyle was fourteen years old and couldn’t even drive</p>

<p>The dealership just laughed and would not let him sit inside.</p>

<p>When he showed them all the money and said he got it all himself</p>

<p>The salesman took a step back and called his manager for help</p>

<p>Kyle overheard the word “police” and decided to run away</p>

<p>He’d rather not be arrested; he could try another day.</p>

<p>For the next week Kyle sulked, all his plans seemed to be shot</p>

<p>The cash stuffed in his dresser, for he knew that he could not</p>

<p>Show anyone his fortune out of fear that they’d ask “how?”</p>

<p>All he did was eat more corndogs and lay around just like a cow.</p>

<p>One evening he had a thought, another plan began to form</p>

<p>What else could make him cool in school? He rememberd Jason Horn</p>

<p>Bragging about having a girlfriend who lived two towns away</p>

<p>“Maybe I can get a girlfriend!” Kyle started right away.</p>

<p>He took a shower, shaved his peach fuzz, ran comb throughout his hair,</p>

<p>Put on his favorite polo shirt, and then he just stood there</p>

<p>In front of his dark closet, wondering if he really had</p>

<p>It in him to get a girlfriend; also, wouldn’t this be “bad”?</p>

<p>With corndogs and cash he didn’t share a second’s though of guilt</p>

<p>He assumed that it was magic, but a girl could not be built</p>

<p>Out of batter oil and sausages; would it be someone from school?</p>

<p>If the closet kidnapped his friend Emily, would that be cruel?</p>

<p>But his guilt quickly subsided; all he had to do was try,</p>

<p>After all, nothing bad had ever happened any other time.</p>

<p>So he stood at darkened closet and said “boy I love a girl</p>

<p>Who will be my girlfriend” and he  stepped back just to see what would occur.</p>

<p>Thick smoke, white and sulphurous, began to creep along the floor</p>

<p>And a shadowy human shape slowly appeared in closet door</p>

<p>With nerves like rubber bands Kyle turned on his bedroom light</p>

<p>And before him stood a woman; he could not believe the sight!</p>

<p>She was beautiful, so stunning, tall and fit with luscious curves,</p>

<p>She was dressed in sexy lingerie; she didn’t say a word</p>

<p>But she looked a Kyle with sexy eyes, then lifted up her hand</p>

<p>And beckoned him towards her, then whispered to “come in”.</p>

<p>Kyle never talked to women, to be honest he was scared</p>

<p>So he stood for many moments unable to go there</p>

<p>But the woman stayed and smiled at him and tempted him inside</p>

<p>And he didn’t even notice that her smile was just a bit too wide.</p>

<p>He took a single step towards her, then another, three</p>

<p>And the woman’s wide seductive smile began to shine with glee</p>

<p>He stood before her in the closet, nervous, then looked up at</p>

<p>Her eyes, which seemed to be less human and more like a cat’s.</p>

<p>As Kyle passed the closet threshold the woman grinned wide</p>

<p>And Kyle saw three rows of teeth as sharp as kitchen knives</p>

<p>He panicked, now conflicted, as his horniness and fear</p>

<p>Fought battles in his brain; the smile seemed more like a leer.</p>

<p>The woman looked down at him, saliva began to drip</p>

<p>Out of her mouth. Kyle turned, but too bad he wasn’t quick</p>

<p>Enough to run away; behind him slammed the closet door</p>

<p>And Kyle, corndog lover, was unfortunately no more.</p>

<p>Kyle’s parents never found him, they were horribly distressed</p>

<p>And some demon had a tasty meal on corndog-fattened flesh.</p>

<p>Is there a moral to this story? Some lesson that we could take?</p>

<p>Fuck if I know; I think tonight I’ll cook a tasty steak.</p>
