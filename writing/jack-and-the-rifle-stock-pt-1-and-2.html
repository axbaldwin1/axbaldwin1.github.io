          <h1>Jack And The Rifle Stock Pt 1 And 2</h1>
        </header>

        <p>The snow came down heavy and wet, soaking through Jack’s heavy coat and chilling him to the core. Not that it was hard; there was barely muscle and no fat on his skinny frame, kept lean from starvation-level food rations and daily work in the fields. Usually winter represented a break, a time to sleep away the hunger and huddle in front of a fire with the rest of the workers in the chiefdom, telling stories and singing the occasional low, sad song. But his overseer had ordered him to go to the next village over and deliver a package, and he made it clear that their lord, who ruled not only their farm but all the surrounding farms and villages with an iron fist, wanted it done immediately.</p>

<p>Jack smiled. Lord Renly might rule with an iron fist and crush anyone who openly defied him, but that fist left plenty of room for things to slip through his fingers. In fact, winter was also a great time to raid storerooms and steal food from the great keep, allowing his people to survive an especially harsh winter or an unexpected cruelty from one of the lesser overseers, who were always giving extra beatings to try to impress their bosses. It allowed the stealing of small valuables, pickpocketed from an overseer or swiped by one of the peasants serving in the keep and passed down through a complex black market of barter and charity until it got to someone who could use it. And, on trips like the one Jack was on, it allowed news of the outside world to be passed between lordships and for the peasants to keep abreast of the comings and goings around them. The last the peasants had heard, things weren’t looking good; some sort of calamity in the west had drawn most of the soldiers from the villages, and overseers were ordered to be extra tough in order to prevent unrest. There were even worries of peasant conscription, of him and his people being forced to march into spears and swords while Lord Renly’s professional troops drove them on. Death on both sides. He, and the rest of the workers, hoped that Jack’s trip would bring them better news.</p>

<p>A tall thin man in a long robe passed on the opposite side of the road. His clothes were rich and full, shining with a light that for Jack seemed to come from an unusual source. Above him, a swirling wind held off the snow, blowing it away so that he stayed dry. Some of the snow blew onto Jack, getting him even colder; the man, upon noticing this, sneered and blew even more snow Jack’s way. Wizards. Generally self-serving snobs that only cared about money and staying in the good graces of the lordships, wizards usually looked down upon any peasant as a matter of course. Wizardry was strictly forbidden by every lord in the kingdom under penalty of instant death, unless, of course, you carried both a certificate from the wizarding guild and a letter of license signed by at least one lord. While peasants occasionally (and clandestinely) used minor wizardry to heal and help with housework, in practice no peasant ever achieved entrance into the wizarding guild and therefore all wizards came from second or third sons of the lords. Peasants occasionally paid for the services of wizards, but knowing that the peasants had no other choice wizards generally charged exorbitant prices for even the smallest healings or protection spells. If they couldn’t pay, or if the wizard was an especially bad one, they might take one of the daughters of the peasants as “compensation”. Though, Jack knew, this practice wasn’t guaranteed. At least one angry peasant father had instead fought and killed the wizard instead of letting him take his daughter, and while the whole family had of course been immediately executed by their lord, it made wizards think twice before trying anything too exploitative.</p>

<p>As far as Jack was concerned, wizards should stay in the northern wastelands fighting the dragons and leave the normal people alone.</p>

<p>Shivering, wet, and exhausted by the walk, he finally arrived in the neighboring village right as the sun was setting behind the trees. He dutifully found the house he was directed to (“red door, two to the right, ask for Clancy”) and handed off the package to what looked like a minor lord or rich local craftsman. Waiting on a coin in return, instead he got a door slammed in his face. He knocked again, and upon seeing him still standing there in the cold Clancy just rolled his eyes, but told him to wait a second. After waiting considerably longer than a second Clancy returned with a thick slice of bread topped with pungent unicorn cheese and instructions to “fuck off, ye dirty peasant”. Jack happily ate the snack and headed to the nearest peasant barracks to spend the night.</p>

<p>The night passed uneventfully; the village peasants, somewhat more wealthy than Jack’s farm peasants, shared their gruel and told him the latest news. Apparently one traveler had said that the calamity to the west was the work of one man, some new type of wizard, and the local lord had pulled out all of his favors to get help in putting this wizard down. Rumor was he had even asked the great king for dragon rider support, and had been laughed out of the castle. This rumor started the typical arguing about dragons common to any peasant barracks hall (“I heard the dragons are our enemy” “well I heard they don’t even exist” “actually, the king himself has a pet dragon he rides” “no that’s not true, only wizards can ride dragons” “I thought wizards kill dragons, that’s how they earn their wizard license” “if a wizard can kill a dragon then how come a bunch of peasants can kill a wizard eh?”) which continued until Jack, much warmer, laid down to sleep before heading back the next morning.</p>

<p>He awoke suddenly to a bang and the crackling of several torches, held by men in soldier gear who had just busted down the door to the barracks. They grabbed Jack and the other peasant men and, making sure to inflict a bit more cruelty than necessary, herded them out the door. Jack was terrified, but the half-awake stupor left him just confused enough that by the time he fully regained his senses he was already stuck in line with the other peasant men, hands tied together, being forced to march through the cold slush on the road (thankfully it had stopped snowing). They were forced to march for hours, without being told where or why, until the black sky started to grey with the first light of dawn. As the sun began to rise they came over a hill and saw a row of tents, with a bonfire in the middle. One of the men herding the peasants smiled. “Welcome to the king’s army”, he said. Jack groaned.</p>

<p>Conscription, it turned out, wasn’t that much different from the daily life of a farm peasant. Every morning Jack woke up, was yelled at and occasionally beaten, ran around on a cold wet field with a wooden implement (a spear with a fire-hardened tip instead of a hoe or rake this time) while overseers yelled instructions that made no sense, then returned to a fire and some weak gruel. In fact, considering the hours of field training were less than farming and the gruel was thicker and more plentiful, Jack caught himself being almost thankful that he had been rounded up. Of course, some of the older men had a different feeling about it all. Apparently another village had had their peasants rounded up about a month ago, and none of them had returned home sense. While Jack assumed they must just be out marching around looking silly someplace else, he had to admit that the thought of battles and massacres did keep him up at night.</p>

<p>There was also, to balance out the sticks of the overseers, the carrot of promotion. For anyone that did something heroic in battle, the overseers said, lay not just better food and comfort but a place as an overseer in the king’s army. Play your cards right, they said, and you could live a good life like us. Jack didn’t take this seriously. The lords and upper class had too many children and were always looking for things to keep them busy. There was no reason they would let peasants into that world. But some of the other young men seemed to get hope from this, and when they started marching again after a week of training those peasants were at the front of the line, smiling and looking forward to an imagined reward after an exciting battle. Jack stuck to the middle, hoping that the battle wouldn’t take place. After a day’s march they rested, ate, and got a little sleep, then started up again the next morning. On the third day, the overseers handed out spears and some leather armor and ordered them to get into formation. Then, slowly advancing in a tight line through the woods, they crept forward.</p>

<p>For the first hour Jack didn’t see anything. Then, without warning, he saw a severed hand lying on the ground in front of him. The hand seemed, not cut, but ripped off of the arm it was once attached to, with sinew and bones trailing behind it. Jack stopped, paralyzed. He had seen plenty of farm injuries of course, and animal attacks happened occasionally, but at least those times the thing that was causing issues was known. As the people down the line heard about the hand a murmur started and the line stopped moving. The overseers, in a harsh whisper, ordered them forward. They sounded scared. The line stayed still. Finally, the head overseer drew his sword, walked over to Jack, and kicked the hand out of the way. “Move” he ordered, holding the sword at the back of Jack’s neck. Jack started to walk, and the rest of the line followed.</p>

<p>Soon they encountered more bodies with missing limbs, huge gaps carved out of their chests, or occasionally just small holes as if from a rapier but piercing straight through metal and leather armor alike. The march forward got slower and quieter. Jack felt himself crouching unconsciously, trying to make himself smaller. The tension was high, and everyone’s nerves were on edge. But, besides the carnage around him, the day was peaceful. But this only increased the tension, as nobody knew which direction the danger would come from.</p>

<p>At the other end of the line, one of the conscripts tripped. As he fell he grabbed a dead branch nearby, which ripped off of the tree with a huge CRACK. This was enough to break the tension. At the sound of the branch breaking everyone scattered, dropping their spears and fleeing in all directions. Even the overseers ran. Jack took off as well, caught in the herd instinct to flee the predator and find somewhere safe, but he had no idea which way he was going and soon the cries of the other peasants faded. He kept going, not knowing what else to do, and by nightfall was deep into the woods and completely lost. He eventually found a rocky outcropping that, he figured, might have a cave that he could hide in for the night, and headed towards it. When he got closer he saw that it did in fact have a large, deep cave, hidden from view in all directions. Relieved, he started to go inside.</p>

<p>“Stop,” said a sudden gruff voice. He felt cold metal on the back of his neck. Jack froze. “Get on your knees” the voice commanded. Instead, Jack ran forward. However, with the cave in front of him and the man behind him he had nowhere to run. He turned and faced the man, ready to either fight or plead. What he saw surprised him.</p>

<p>The man was much taller than him or any other peasant he had ever seen. He wore garments made of leaves and bark, but sewn together so tightly that they covered his entire body. On his head he also wore a hat of leaves. Despite the strange clothes he had on what looked like fine leather boots and gloves. But the most interesting thing was what he carried, what he had threatened Jack with. Before seeing it, Jack thought it must be a sword. But the object the man carried was instead a strange club, narrow as a stick at one end and large and pointy at the other, made of a black metal that looked to Jack like polished cast iron. The man was holding the large end close to his chest with both ends and pointing the small end at Jack. “Get on your knees,” the man said again, and then started coughing and hacking uncontrollably. Jack thought he saw some blood fly out of the man’s mouth. Ah, Jack realized, he has the red lung disease. Jack himself had caught it when he was younger, though luckily he had recovered. But he figured that if the man was sick then he could beat him in a fight, club or no.</p>

<p>Jack took a few steps towards the man, meaning to attack. Instead of running or fighting, the man pointed the small end of the club to the sky and, while making eye contact with Jack, made a small motion with his hand.</p>

<p>It was as if he called lightning from the heavens. A flash from the club blinded Jack, and at the same time a roar louder than thunder made him deaf. He stumbled backwards and sank to his knees. This, he realized, must be the wizard that he was sent to fight. He now realized that he had never had any chance, and that he was about to die. But instead the wizard lowered what Jack know knew was a wizard’s staff and pointed it at the ground. He sighed. “Listen kid,” the man said, “I’m sick and need help. If you help me, and do exactly what I say, I’ll not only let you live but I’ll give you a great treasure. But, if you try to run away, hurt me, or lie to me in any way, I will kill you immediately. Now get up and go into the cave.” Not having any choice, Jack went inside.</p>

<p>Pt 2.</p>

<p>Jack crouched behind the rock, a light breeze brushing his hair back as it blew towards him. Ahead of him about 250 yards, a medium-sized deer grazed. Jack knew that any moment the wind could change and blow his scent towards the animal, causing it to flee. His heart pounded in his ears. Slowly, he leaned down and looked through the scope of his M4A1 carbine, sighting the rifle against the center of the deer’s chest.</p>

<p>No matter how many times he had used this thing in the past month, the fear never left. He knew he was playing with a power beyond his control, holding life and death in his hands. But he also knew that his heartbeat, breathing, and tension in his arms could easily cause a shot to go wild and miss the animal. So remembering his lessons he started to breathe...four seconds in, four second hold, four seconds out, four seconds hold, repeated gently as to not make a noise. After 30 seconds of this he felt his heart slow, his breath steady. Moving very, very slowly, he raised his finger to the safety and clicked it off. At the click, the animal looked up, aware that this very unnatural sound meant something was amiss but not recognizing the click of steel for a predator. The deer tensed as if to run, but hesitated. And in that moment of hesitation Jack pulled the trigger.</p>

<p>A crash of thunder filled the forest, causing every bird and small creature to flee in terror. Jack felt the stock of the rifle pound into his shoulder. As the reverberations echoed through the forest Jack stood and looked over the rock. In front of him, the deer lay dead, it’s head a mangled mess of brains and tendons. Jack cursed. Looks like he still pulled back just a bit when firing, causing his shot to go a bit high. Still, compared to how his aim had been on the first day, he was getting better. He just still some fear of this magical weapon left to conquer. And at least this time he still had meat. Grinning through the nerves, Jack went up to butcher the deer.</p>

<p>When Jack returned to the cave it was almost dark. The wizard, he saw with sadness, had let the fire burn down to its coals. The wizard was often delirious these days as the sickness with which Jack had found him had started making its way into his brain. Jack sighed and, dropping the meat, started to re-build their little fire.</p>

<p>When Jack had first met the wizard he had stayed with him out of fear. The wizard had told him that if he ran away, lightning would be called down from anywhere in the world and strike him down instantly. This had kept Jack coming back with berries and edible tubers to help sustain the wizard, and carrying water from the stream almost an hour’s walk away. He had helped tend to the wizard’s broken leg and help him through the first fevers. After a week or so, the wizard started to let him into his secrets.</p>

<p>The wizard never spoke of his home, or how he ended up in the cave. But after Jack told him about the deer grazing nearby the wizard took him aside. “Tell me about your world,” he commanded, and so Jack told him about the harvests, about the camaraderie and fear among the peasants, the oppression by the great lords and the indifference of the wizards. He spoke all night of his life, and by the morning the wizard seemed satisfied. “I know I’m dying,” the wizard said, “and I don’t want to die in vain. I’ll teach you some of my secrets in return for two things. One, you stay with me until the end. Don’t let me die alone. And two, you use what I teach you to bring justice to your world, not to oppress or harm anyone who doesn’t deserve it.” Jack agreed. And the next day, the wizard started teaching Jack how to use the rifle.</p>

<p>A month later, Jack and the wizard were, if not friends, then definitely loyal companions. More and more the wizard was delirious with fever and brain infection, but Jack would not have left him even if he didn’t still fear the wizard’s power. That night, he build up the fire and cooked each of them a venison steak, then left the rest of the meat hanging over the flames to smoke. He wiped the wizard down with warm water soaked in pine and made sure his bed was comfortable. He cleaned the rifle the way the wizard had taught him, then put it in it’s case at the back of the cave, near the ammunition. Then he went to sleep.</p>

<p>A week later the wizard died. Jack buried him just outside the cave. Then Jack filled his pack with smoked venison and as much ammunition as he could carry and left the cave for the last time.</p>

<p>Jack arrived back at his village a week later. At first, his own family didn’t recognize him. He didn’t realize how much his time living in the cave had changed him, not only making him dirtier and matting his hair but making him stronger (thanks to a steady supply of venison). He arrived after dark, to avoid overseers, and started telling his family what had happened, but then stopped. For some reason it just didn’t seem like the right time to explain. Being back among his people, eating peasant gruel and hearing the same stories he had heard a thousand times before, just didn’t seem as interesting anymore. Several people asked about the rifle, but all Jack told them was that it was a magical artifact he had been given and that if anybody but him touched it they would die. He figured that it would be better if nobody tried to figure out how to use it on their own and accidentally shot themselves.  He went to sleep feeling the eyes of the other peasants on him, clutching the rifle to his chest, with the ammo bag as a pillow.</p>

<p>The next morning, word came from the overseers that Lord Renly wanted a young girl to be his “wine servant” that night. Despite the euphemisms everyone knew what that really meant, and the girl chosen, who couldn’t be more than 14 years old, cried and begged to be left. But the overseers didn’t listen, and when her father tried to protest he cuffed the father in the head again and again until he couldn’t stand up. Jack didn’t see the start of this, but on hearing a noise he walked over to see the overseers dragging the girl away with the father bleeding on the ground and the mother crying. Jack had a moment’s hesitation. Interfering with what Lord Renly wanted, he knew, carried the penalty of death for his whole family. But he had made the wizard a promise. And now he could do something about this injustice.</p>

<p>In a smooth motion he raised the rifle to his shoulder, sighted on the center of the overseer’s chest, flicked off the safety, and pulled the trigger.</p>

<p>After the sound died down, the overseer lay dead in a pool of blood. All the peasants just turned to stare at Jack, not knowing what to think, frozen in shock. The assistant overseer, after a few seconds of paralysis, turned and ran. Jack looked around and realized that things would never be the same now. Lord Renly would, of course, send more people to take revenge, and he would have to defend his people once again. Then the lords would band together to crush them all; even with the rifle, Jack probably couldn’t take on a whole army at once. But that’s ok, Jack thought. The peasants outnumber lords 100 to 1, and if I can use this power to convince them to band together, we might have a chance. Jack smiled. Time to go to war.</p>

<p>Pt. 3</p>

<p>Flash in: Jack is trying to train the peasants. They had one successful battle against Lord Renly but only because Jack shot him and everyone else ran away.</p>

<p>The peasants aren’t taking this seriously, they think they could easily win and just get to be lords again.</p>

<p>Jack is frustrated.</p>

<p>Goes to vent his frustration to his mother? Girlfriend? Father? Someone else that reassures him that, when the time is right, the peasants will step up.</p>

<p>They train for a couple more days. Some of the men are starting to take charge. They have swords for most people due to the armory, farming equipment for others.</p>

<p>Jack has to explain that he can’t magically save everyone, they need to be prepared for real war.</p>

<p>One morning, in the distance, dragons! Ridden by wizards shooting fireballs (that are very easy to defend against, just use any shield. Or even get hit and then stop drop and roll)</p>

<p>In front of the dragons there is a line of soldiers in full armor. The peasants are outnumbered</p>

<p>Jack first marches right up in the middle of the field. The largest dragon goes ahead and targets Jack. Jack shoots him, kills him and the wizard. The rest of the army is shocked, and quickly retreats / makes camp far away from the castle.</p>

<p>It’s a siege. The peasants stay inside the keep.</p>

<p>It’s a rainy night. Jack leaves to do recon. Finds out that all the great lords have come there personally to destroy the peasant rebellion.</p>

<p>Tries sneaking away but is caught. The gun is back in the keep so they don’t get it. Jack plays dumb, says he can convince the “great wizard” to surrender. They let him go back in as a messenger.</p>

<p>He goes in and immediately the forces charge. The peasants go out to stop them. Bloody battle.</p>

<p>In the midst of it, Jack gets gun back and then goes on a killing spree, killing all the dragons and then the lords. However, he gets mortally wounded somehow.</p>

<p>At the end, the army retreats but the peasants can’t weather another battle.</p>

<p>Jack lays dying, his final request is for the survivors to run. To sneak out under the cover of dark and tell all the other peasants that the dragons and lords are dead. This is the time for rebellion. Jack may not have singlehandedly saved the kingdom, but he is the one who weakened it enough that the peasants can now take power.</p>

<p>The end.</p>
