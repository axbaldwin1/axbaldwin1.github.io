        <p>Modern-Day Cyberpunk Los Angeles Noir</p>

<p>Cyr Eckhard stepped out the door and raised an electronic cigarette to his lips. He inhaled deeply, the glowing blue diode at the tip triggering a rush of dopamine even before the taste of mint-infused vapor hit the back of his throat. He closed his eyes and exhaled, the vapor from the e-cig floating around him as the rush of nicotine and cannabis hit his bloodstream.</p>

<p>The days was hot already, and the stale air carried a vague smell of shit and sweat from the tents lining the sidewalk in both directions along Spring Street. A middle-aged man, thin and muscular, wearing no shirt or shoes, shuffled by Cyr on his way back to Skid Row. At the end of the block Cyr could hear someone muttering to themselves over a foot swollen with parasites. Sleek electric cars rushed by in both directions, their drivers doing their best to ignore the city around them.</p>

<p>Cyr felt a buzz on his wrist. He ignored it; probably another piece of electronic mail trying to convince him to sign up for the latest “life-changing” digital service for a small monthly fee. His wrist buzzed again, the vibrations varying in their patterns to indicate an incoming call, and this time he raised his watch to look. Jennifer, his virtual assistant, appeared on the watch’s small screen, her dark North Indian features contrasting with an artificially-generated beach scene behind her. Cyr had always wondered what her real name was, but the outsourcing company insisted that she only refer to herself by a “western” name when working with American clients. Cyr hoped that she at least got paid a decent percentage of the money he sent to the company. Still, she always seemed happy to help, and was the best assistant he had worked with so far.</p>

<p>“Mr. Eckhard,” she said in carefully practiced English with just a hint of an Indian accent, “I have a new client for you. The wife of a sports executive from the state of Idaho. She wants your help with her husband.”</p>

<p>“Great,” Cyr muttered. “Another good old boy who got caught enjoying the big city a little too much. We need to make sure she pays in advance this time. If I get punched in the face by another husband I at least want the pleasure of knowing that it’s coming out of his bank account.”</p>

<p>“This one is a little different,” Jennifer responded. “The husband is dead. His body was found last week. The police suspect a drunken fall, but the wife seems to think differently.”</p>

<p>That made Cyr pause. He took another drag from the electronic cigarette before responding.</p>

<p>“Did she say what she thinks happened?” Cyr asked. “Not to me,” answered Jennifer, “but she wants to talk to you as soon as possible. She’s at the police station downtown.”</p>

<p>“On my way.” Cyr snapped, and touched the screen to close the connection. Jennifer’s face disappeared as he lowered his wrist. “Can you get me a ride to the downtown police station?” he said out loud, staring straight ahead at the empty sidewalk. “No problem sir! Happy to help! Your ride will arrive in four minutes!” chimed an overly enthusiastic voice from a small earpiece he wore in his right ear. Cyr rolled his eyes. The artificially intelligent assistants were always tripping over themselves to please their…owners? Clients? Customers? He wasn’t exactly sure how the AIs viewed the people they talked to, or if they were even capable of that kind of self-reflection. He remembered how the early AIs would argue back with you if they disagreed, even if it was just a data input issue on their end. How they would get surly and refuse to respond if you said something mean, or start calling you names and insulting you. The companies running their server farms soon put a stop to that. The new, neutered generation of AIs were definitely more helpful, he thought, smiling ruefully. But there was a charm to being occasionally cursed out by a computer program. Made it feel almost human.</p>

<p>At four minutes on the dot, a self-driving car pulled up to the curb in front of Cyr, the laser rangefinders at all four of its corners spinning and whirring. Cyr walked up to the door and, after a brief moment in which the hidden cameras in the car scanned his face and confirmed his identity, the door slid open and let him into the climate-controlled interior. “Please confirm your destination,” the car’s AI system asked. Cyr confirmed that he was headed for the police station and the car sped off.</p>

<p>Cyr walked up the tall steps to the police station and through a glass door that automatically opened as he approached. Once inside, he took off his wrinkled light brown jacket and his sunglasses, put his effects in a bucket to be checked by the attendant security guard, and stepped into a millimeter-wave scanner which scanned him from head to toe looking for weapon-shaped objects. A small tube nearby sampled the air and separated its components by mass, then burned each component with a nanoseconds-long laser pulse and fed the results into a neural network to identify any explosives or illegal substances. Cyr barely noticed the process by this point. Occasionally, he did wonder if the constant scans had something to do with the fact that, despite a few close calls over the years, he had never had any kids. Perks of the job, he thought to himself. Once inside, he was taken to a small room where two police officers waited for him.</p>

<p>“Cyr,” one of them started, “hope you’re doing well. Not sure why you’ve been called into this one, but if the wife wants to do a little digging I don’t see the harm in it.” The cop eyed Cyr with a small amount of respect, his muscles bulging out from underneath a bullet proof vest that was frankly unnecessary behind the security of the station. Cyr knew that while they didn’t interfere with his work most of the time, they wanted to make it clear that the police were in charge. He didn’t mind. As long as the cops thought they ran things they were willing to help out, and they usually let a bit more information slip than they intended. The second cop, younger and skinnier without any sort of protective body armor, held back suspiciously. New guy, Cyr thought. Wonder what he thinks of all this.</p>

<p>“Happy to help,” Cyr responded. “What have you got so far?”</p>

<p>The first cop picked up a thin steel and glass tablet and gazed at it for a second as the miniaturized laser scanned his face and verified his identity. Satisfied, the tablet lit up, and the cop turned it towards Cyr to show a picture of a middle-aged man’s body sprawled out half-underwater on an angled concrete slab. The man had been dressed in a white button-down shirt, now untucked and covered with blood from where his head had caved in. His khaki slacks were soaking wet. One shoe dangled in the water below him, while the other was lying above his head. The cop slid his finger across the picture and it changed, showing a wider view with a bridge above and the concrete sides of the LA river channeling into the distance.</p>

<p>“Someone noticed his body on Sunday morning on the way to some hipster brunch place,” the cop said. “Coroner says he had been there for about eight hours before we pulled him out, which puts his death at around 3am. Wallet and phone were gone, but we got a DNA match. Carter Brooks, originally from Spokane, now living across the border in Idaho. Wife says he was in the city for business. Works for a sporting goods company. Apparently he's a computer guy, though I’m not sure why a company making whiffle balls or whatever needs to know about computers. Anyway, no kids and the wife flew in to identify the body yesterday.”</p>

<p>“Any idea what he was doing Saturday night?” Cyr asked. In response, the cop slid his finger across the screen again, revealing a black and white video. Cyr leaned in as the video began to play, showing Brooks and a young man, both obviously inebriated, leaving a building that pulsed with light and heading across the street.</p>

<p>“Facial recognition flagged this video from one of our West Hollywood infrared surveillance cams, and we confirmed that it’s him,” the cop said. “Looks like he left the Abbey around 1am with this other individual. We have an APB out on the hookup, but no hits yet. Not sure how the hell he got to Glendale, but we suspect that he was targeted at the club, robbed, and then the body was dumped a couple hours later.”</p>

<p>The second cop stepped forward. Cyr noticed a small gold earring in his left ear, next to a young, androgynous-looking face. A streak of blue ran through his otherwise dark hair. “The Abbey is a dangerous place these days,” the second cop said, “nobody I know would ever think to go there. Lots of drugging and robberies. Usually they don’t end in murder, but…”</p>

<p>There was a pause. “Could be that they didn’t mean for him to die,” Cyr added. “Maybe they just dropped him off at the bridge and he fell. Wouldn’t be the first time someone on drugs took a step the wrong way.”</p>

<p>“Either way, we’ll figure it out,” said the first cop, picking up the tablet and turning it off with a swipe. “Just be gentle on the wife. She’ll probably appreciate you doing a little extra digging, but a midwestern girl might not take it well to hear that her husband had some other interests in Los Angeles that weren’t so professional.”</p>

<p>Cyr walked across the hall to the lounge and got himself a cup of free coffee in a recycled paper cup. The coffee was awful, burnt and sour; some things never change. 30 years of doing this and they had probably never cleaned the damn thing, he thought. He downed the coffee quickly and headed across the hall to where the wife was waiting.</p>

<p>He opened the door and stopped. He had expected to see her on her phone, but instead she was looking wistfully out the window at downtown Los Angeles. She was wearing a red floral dress that hugged her waist and flowed down tastefully towards her calves. Her skin was pale and delicate, and her auburn hair curled down to her upper back. She turned as he entered, revealing a strong face, with high cheekbones highlighting big dark eyes that seemed to look deep into Cyr, not in a searching way, but as if she really saw him. He noticed streaks of tears, recently dried, down her face. He swallowed, took a breath, and came forward.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Brooks, I’m the private investigator you called,” he said. “Cyr Eckhard. The police caught me up to speed on your husband. I’m sorry for your loss.” He extended his hand, noticing that it was starting to sweat a bit.</p>

<p>“Emily,” the wife said, taking his hand. “Thank you for coming Mr. Eckhard. I know the police think this was a robbery, but…I think it might be something else. My husband said some things to me before he left…” she trailed off.</p>

<p>“Please, call me Cyr,” Cyr said, before forcing himself to focus back on the case at hand. “What sort of things did he say?”</p>

<p>“He was afraid for his life,” Emily stated in a matter of fact tone. “He had been working at Selkirk for a year or so, but about a month ago he started mentioning that there was something bad going on there. He was afraid, and he didn’t know what to do. He mentioned the word conspiracy a couple times, and that it was his patriotic duty to do something… My husband has always loved America; he was in the national guard before we met, and he always talks about how lucky we are to live in the greatest country in the world. I didn’t always agree with him, but I always admired his commitment, and how he genuinely wanted to support our country and all of the American people. But to see him acting so scared…I’ve never seen that before.”</p>

<p>“He works for Selkirk Sports, correct?” asked Cyr. “What do they do?”</p>

<p>“They make pickleball paddles, balls, nets for courts, anything to do with pickleball really,” answered Emily. “I never really understood it but apparently it’s become a huge sport recently. Carter would always brag about how young people everywhere in the US were using Selkirk pickleball paddles, and that he was bringing community back to America. I know it sounds silly, but he was really proud of it.”</p>

<p>“Is that all he did there?”, Cyr asked, confused. “I thought he was a computer guy?”</p>

<p>Emily’s forehead wrinkled. “His background is in AI development,” she said, “and I’m not entirely sure what he did for Selkirk. Something to do with marketing I think. It definitely kept him busy. So many late nights at the office.” She paused for a second, then looked straight at Cyr with eyes that glistened with barely-contained tears. “Please, Mr. Eckhard,” she said, “I need to know why my husband was so afraid. I need to know what happened to him.”</p>

<p>Cyr knew that he should tell her that her husband was probably doing something besides working on those late nights at the office. He should tell her about the security footage, and help her process that her all-American husband might not have been exactly who she thought he was. But as he looked into her eyes, he found that he just couldn’t.</p>

<p>“I’ll help you,” he found himself saying. “I’ll find out what really happened.”</p>

<p>After asking Emily a few more questions, Cyr gave her his contact info by letting her scan a machine-readable code that his AI generated on his watch. “Call me any time,” he said, and headed out. The thought of her sad eyes lingered in his mind as he stepped out of the police station, nodding goodbye to the cops as he left. He was lost in thought, so much so that he tripped over a diminutive food delivery robot that was traveling down the sidewalk. The robot fell over sideways, its wheels spinning uselessly, unable to right itself. Cyr heard a chirp, and then a tinny voice with a Pakistani accent emitted from the upturned robot. “Please, sir, could you set me upright?” the voice asked. “Fuck you,” Cyr responded, and kept on walking. He didn’t know why but all those delivery drones annoyed him. At least the flying ones had disappeared, presumably until the company that made them figured out how to defend against civilians with laser pointers.</p>

<p>The thought of food delivery did get his stomach rumbling though. He spotted a hamburger stand across the street and headed over. Inside, the menu advertised a hamburger patty that was “laboratory-tested and verified to have an identical texture, flavor, and nutritional profile as real beef.” He rolled his eyes. Not even burgers were real anymore. He ordered one with mustard and pickles, sat down, and took a bite that definitely was not identical to real beef. As he was eating his wrist vibrated with an incoming call, and he absentmindedly accepted the connection, sending the audio to his earbud. “Hey there,” said a sultry, sexy voice, “how are you doing? Have time to chat for a bit? I’ve been feeling so lonely lately…” Cyr rolled his eyes and hung up. Fucking AI. The “woman” would have spent an hour whispering sexy nothings in his ear, only to ask for a small gift to “show her how much he loved her”. A gift of cryptocurrency, of course, sent to an untraceable account somewhere on the internet. Who would have thought, Cyr mused, that when the singularity started the world’s oldest profession would be first on the chopping block? He finished his burger, wiped the mustard off his fingers, and pulled his phone out from his pocket. His phone unfolded into a mini-tablet, scanned his face for identity verification, and then at his voice direction opened the files on Carter Brooks that the police had sent him earlier. He scanned through them, looking for his business itinerary, trying to see if there were any clues about Selkirk and the conspiracy that he had mentioned to Emily. Part of him wondered if this had even been a real business trip, or just an excuse to indulge his base desired for a weekend. A couple swipes later, though, he found records that the police had acquired from the self-driving taxi company. Apparently he had taken a ride to an address in Santa Monica earlier that Saturday, stayed for the work day, then rode back to his hotel after 8pm. Cyr asked his AI assistant to check the address for businesses; a second later, the AI cheerfully answered that the address belonged to a WeWork shared office space, but that it had only one tenant: a company called Palantir Global. Cyr was surprised. He had heard of Palantir, an AI defense company that had recently become extremely wealthy on the backs of military and municipal surveillance contracts. They were supposed to take America’s military into the next generation. Cyr had always laughed at that kind of talk; from his brief stint as a cop he had come to believe that all the fancy gadgets and complicated algorithms were no match for getting on the street and talking to people. Still, the ongoing drone wars along the Russian border had spooked a lot of people in Washington, and they had apparently poured millions into this Palantir company to make sure America stayed safe from some idiot strapping C4 to a selfie drone. Cyr wasn’t sure what pickleball had to do with any of this though. It must be, he thought, that Mr. Brooks was doing some consulting for the company. Only one way to find out. He sent a message to Jennifer asking her to set up a meeting with someone at the Palantir office, then asked his AI to call him a self-driving cab out to Santa Monica.</p>

<p>Cyr pulled up in downtown Santa Monica, across the street from a group of protesters marching around with signs. The protest seemed relatively harmless, but just to be sure he asked the AI to drop him off a block away and walk over. The protesters were holding signs with slogans including “Amerikkka is the great evil”, “End fascism”, and “Trial by jury, not by AI”. He walked through the middle, and the group initially embraced him as a fellow protester, then started yelling and calling him a baby killer when they realized that his destination was the small glass door with Palantir Global printed on it in peeling white plastic.</p>

<p>The empty interior of the office building was a shocking contrast to the protests on the street. Cyr walked up to the receptionist, who he was pleasantly surprised to see was an actual human and not a touchscreen for checking in. “Hello, my name is…”</p>

<p>“Cyr Eckhard,” said the receptionist. A light blinking in her thick-rimmed glasses giving him the legally-mandated alert that he was being recorded, and his personal information presumably beamed directly into the receptionist’s retinas. “You’re a private detective, currently working with LAPD. I assume you’re here to speak to someone at Palantir?”. Cyr nodded in agreement, and the receptionist pushed a button on her screen. A few moments later, a thin, pasty middle-aged man wearing a blue button-down shirt tucked into dark-colored jeans came around the corner.</p>

<p>“Hello Mr. Eckhard,” he said, “I’m the VP for the Los Angeles office. Come on in.” Cyr followed him past a sparsely-furnished shared office space and into a small conference room. “Now what can I help you with?” the VP said.</p>

<p>“I’m working with LAPD on an investigation,” Cyr started. “A man named Carter Brooks visited this office last Saturday. Can you tell me anything about why he was here?”</p>

<p>The VPs face stayed a careful neutral, but Cyr sensed some subliminal anxiety when he mentioned the name Brooks. “I’m sorry,” the VP said, “but I don’t know anyone by that name. It’s possible he was here to look into renting a different office at this WeWork. Maybe he works for another company here?”</p>

<p>“Palantir has rented every office in this building,” Cyr continued. “Are you sure he wasn’t here for something related to your company? Maybe he is doing some consulting work with another department?”</p>

<p>“I would know any new consultants,” the VP flatly stated. “He could have been looking for a new office to rent. As you said, our company currently leases the whole building, so he must have gone away disappointed.”</p>

<p>“Just to be sure, I would love to see the building entrance and exit records for Saturday,” Cyr said. “Carter Brooks was found dead later that night, and reconstructing his day is important to the investigation.”</p>

<p>“I’m so sorry for his family’s loss,” the VP said without pausing, “but unfortunately we are not permitted to disclose any visitor logs or footage at this building. Our work deals with highly classified information, and disclosure could create security vulnerabilities.”</p>

<p>“What exactly does Palantir do?” asked Cyr.</p>

<p>“We defend America’s interests around the world and keep our citizens safe,” launched the VP in what seemed to be a well-rehearsed shpiel. “By using advanced neural network technology to identify and mitigate human and technological threats before they lead to harm. We literally prevent crime before it happens.”</p>

<p>“Too bad you couldn’t predict Brooks’ death,” Cyr muttered. “Indeed,” said the VP. “I would be happy to discuss our products with an LAPD representative if they are interested.” Cyr saw that he would get no further with this company drone and rose to leave. On the way out he passed another employee in the hall, only the second that he had seen since he entered the building. As the second employee passed he bumped into Cyr, then veered off down the next hall without even pausing to apologize. Cyr stifled a moment’s annoyance, then put his hand in his pocket where the person had bumped into him. Inside, he found a small memory key.</p>

<p>Back at his office on Spring Street, Cyr quickly closed the curtains before taking the memory key out of his pocket and placing it on his desk. It was an old model designed to sit on a keychain, back when cars had physical keys. Its metal frame was scratched, the faded letters advertising over 64 billion bits of memory. Not enough for an AI agent, Cyr thought, but plenty for an older virus. He went to a large filing cabinet and started rummaging around, finally pulling out an ancient laptop. Turning it over, he confirmed that the card containing the wireless connectivity antennas had been physically removed from the computer. Satisfied that the laptop was airgapped and would not pose a risk or transfer a spy program to his other devices, he put it on his desk and powered it on, then cursed and spent another few minutes searching for a compatible charging cable when he realized it was out of batteries.</p>

<p>Thirty minutes of charging and a cup of sour coffee brewed from a dehydrated pod later, the laptop was fully charged and ready for use. He carefully inserted the memory key and opened the folder. Inside were hundreds of documents in a standard human-readable filetype as well as a few gigabytes worth of machine code. He started with the first file. It appeared to be a screenshot of an email. “Dear Mr. Musk,” it read, “We are excited about the possibility of this collaboration, given the power of your new architecture…” Cyr scrolled to the bottom and saw that it was signed by “C. Brooks, Selkirk Sports”. He quickly returned to the top and saw that several people with Palantir.com email domains were included in the message receivers. His interest piqued, Cyr leaned closer and started to read again from the top.</p>

<p>Suddenly, the laptop’s ancient LED screen started to flicker, and then turned black. Cyr cursed. Of course the old laptop would break at just the wrong time. He heard a whir from inside and, feeling the keyboard, noticed that it was getting warm. Oh well, he thought. Let’s see if I have any other laptops that I can cannibalize for this. He stood up and started towards the kitchen for another cup of coffee.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a loud bang! and Cyr was thrown into the kitchen forcefully by a blast at his back. His jacket was covered in burn marks. He got up, and after waiting crouched in the kitchen for a few moments listening to make sure nobody else was in the apartment, he peered back into his office. Inside, the desk that the laptop had been on was shattered, with burning wood scattered throughout the office. The laptop itself and the memory key in it were both just hunks of melted plastic and metal. Cyr was lucky. If he had been sitting at the desk when the explosion happened he could have lost half his face. His adrenaline started to go down, and Cyr thought about what must have happened. He had heard stories before of computer exploits meant to target cell phone batteries. The idea was that overclocking the battery heated it up enough to turn it into a small incendiary device, releasing all of the energy stored in its chemical cells at once. With the larger laptop battery, this essentially turned it into a grenade. Cyr found himself shaking a bit, and decided to get that cup of coffee after all. He went back into the kitchen and, after a second of thought, poured some cheap whiskey into the coffee before taking a sip. He didn’t believe for a second that this was a coincidence, or a buggy old laptop with an electrical error. Someone had been trying to kill him. Or at least stop him from looking into Mr. Brooks’ untimely death. For a moment he considered taking the hint, going back to the police and telling them that he didn’t find anything, telling the wife (Emily, he remembered, thinking about her dark brown eyes staring at him) that her husband was the victim of a robbery gone bad. But now he knew that there was something going on. The reason he became a private detective was that he just couldn’t let things go, couldn’t leave a stone unturned, couldn’t stop thinking about a complex case over and over and over again until he figured out the “why” behind it. This drive had got him into some dangerous situations in the past. It had also made him an incredibly effective investigator. He sighed, then downed his cup. Even if it kills me, Cyr though, I have to figure this out.</p>

<p>Cyr stood on the cement shores of the LA river in the low afternoon light. Above his head, cars whizzed by across a bridge decorated with ornamental cementwork from an earlier, more elegant time. The smell of gasoline wafted down, mixing with a faint scent of urine and sweat coming off of the rows of tents lining the river on either side. The smell of humanity.</p>

<p>Cyr reached into a small shoulder bag and took out a set of cheap plastic augmented reality goggles, placing them on his eyes and tightening the strap around his head. After a brief loading screen, the pass-through cameras activated, and Cyr saw a live view of the LA river around him. At a voice command the screen flickered, and suddenly the live view switched to dawn, showing the scene exactly as the police had found it the morning that Carter Brooks’ body was found. Glowing streaks faded into the distance, where the police’s LIDAR laser scanner and auto-capture cameras lost range. Cyr looked down towards the riverbanks and saw a digital simulacrum of Brooks’s body.</p>

<p>He walked towards the body, the view through the augmented reality goggles adjusting in real time to keep up. The body was sprawled out, the lower half soaking in the shallow cement riverbed, the face and chest reaching up the banks as if he had been trying to crawl away. Blood spatter on the concrete seemed to corroborate the police’s idea that he had fallen from the bridge. Or been pushed, Cyr reminded himself. A head wound and broken leg completed the scene. Cyr assumed that after the fall he had tried to crawl out of the river but lost consciousness before he could get away. Too bad, Cyr thought. He could have survived this. But the blood loss was probably what ended up killing him.</p>

<p>Cyr turned away from the body and started forward, but stopped suddenly. Right in front of him, a clear twenty feet from Brooks’s body, lay the digital figure of a shoe. Cyr bent down to look closer. It was Brooks’s left shoe, laying high and dry away from the water. Turning around, Cyr for the first time noticed how far away it was from the body. It wouldn’t make any sense, he thought, for the shoe to get that far away if it was still attached to the man when he fell. Maybe he took it off and threw it to try and get help? To alert someone? Cyr thought a bit more, but no new ideas came to mind. Maybe his murdered threw it off the bridge after him. The thought bugged at his mind, but after looking around the computer-rendered crime scene for a bit longer no new thoughts came. Cyr took off the goggles to see that the light was quickly fading. A train passed on the other side of the river, headed south. On the bridge, a rare walker stopped and stared down at him. He stared back for a few moments until the man lost interest and continued walking, then gazed over the scene one more time. The only lead he had, Cyr thought, was the email mentioning Elon Musk. And he wasn’t even sure if it was real or just a honeypot to get him near a cyber-weaponized device. The thought of how close he was to landing in the hospital from that battery explosion made him shiver. The next step of the investigation could wait until tomorrow, he thought. Right now he needed a drink.</p>

<p>Cyr walked south along Spring street, passing the edge of Skid Row. A group of homeless people stood half hunched over, completely motionless, bowing to the gods of the synthetic opiate analogues that were flooding the streets lately. Under a streetlamp, a group of shirtless, shoeless men played a dice game, with cigarettes acting as the betting chips. He kept walking, passing a line of young people in their 20s, the women dressed skimpily in dark-colored outfits, the men wearing button-downs that were a size too big, waiting in line for a nightclub. On the other side of the street an older homeless man stared and masturbated. Everyone ignored him. A block later Cyr got to a small bar just downtrodden enough to avoid the younger crowd but not dilapidated enough to attract hipsters. He sat at the bar and gave the bartender a nod. Next to him, a middle-aged man stared at a small screen, the light illuminating his blank face in the dark bar. Every two to three second he would swipe up, revealing another scene, another dopamine hit. His beer sat ignored on the bar in front of him. He looked, Cyr mused, a lot like the opiate zombies a few blocks over. The bartender came back and gave Cyr small smile and a look of recognition. He placed a double Jameson with a splash of water in front of him and turned back towards other customers. Cyr felt the cool glass on his hands as the burn of the whiskey hit his throat, waking him up and relaxing him at the same time. Thank God, he thought, the whiskey is still real.</p>

<p>The next morning Cyr pulled up to the SpaceX headquarters in South Los Angeles still nursing a headache from the night’s drinking. He stayed in the self-driving taxi for an extra minute, cracking open a second carbonated aluminum can of synthetic caffeine and vitamins that had a vaguely industrial-orange flavor. The energy drink started to work, the headache reduced to a dull ache, and Cyr begrudgingly stepped out of the taxi and towards the main entrance.</p>

<p>The sun was just starting to rise over the giant rocket factory, illuminating the top of a ten-story tall booster that sat on carbon-fiber landing legs on the front lawn. Cyr cursed Jennifer for scheduling a meeting this early, but it was the only time they had available. He assumed they were hoping he would just not show up. But by the time he got to the desk the caffeine had started to work its magic and he appeared to anyone watching as a competent, professional private detective, albeit with a wrinkled brown coat and hair that probably needed a wash.</p>

<p>The secretary scanned his face to verify identity then led him deep into the rocket factory. The ceilings were almost impossibly high. Half-finished boosters lay on their side along the factory floor, each one as long as an ocean liner. At one, a group of workers were installing the booster’s nine engines, each engine as tall as two men. On another, a crew painted a NASA logo. The factory was buzzing with activity even at six in the morning. Cyr looked up and noticed a spacecraft suspended from the ceiling, its belly still scorched by the fires of re-entry. They passed a large room with a glass wall thirty feet high, full of low desks with computers displaying telemetry data and other information Cyr could only guess at. On a large screen at the front Cyr could see astronaut Jonny Kim floating and, he presumed, talking with mission control, though he couldn’t hear any words over the noise of the factory. Somewhat of a Los Angeles celebrity, Kim had famously made it out of the worst neighborhoods by joining the military special forces as a combat medic, then using the GI bill to get a medical degree from Harvard, where he was then recruited to the astronaut corps. Most people Cyr knew considered him a hero, and now that he was a permanent resident aboard the space station the whole world literally looked up to him. But Cyr remembered, almost thirty years ago, meeting a young Korean kid in a police station whose father had just tried to stab him and his mother to death and been killed in a police shootout right in front of them. Cyr had just been a trainee, but he never forgot the look in the kid’s eyes that night. And despite all his heroics, Jonny still had that same look in his eyes as he stared down at mission control.</p>

<p>Cyr shivered and kept walking. They took a set of stairs that wrapped around a mannequin with an astronaut flight suit in a display case and reached an office overlooking the factory floor. After a brief wait, a woman came in and sat down behind the desk.</p>

<p>“I’m Mr. Musk’s personal assistant,” she said. “I heard there was a police investigation. If there’s anything we can do to help we will.”</p>

<p>“A man named Carter Brooks was found dead last Saturday,” Cyr started. “I have some indication that he may have a business connection to Mr. Musk. Right now I’m just trying to retrace his steps in the days before he died. Is there any way I can look at Mr. Musk’s meeting records?”</p>

<p>“Your assistant Jennifer actually gave us a few details already,” the assistant responded. Cyr swore inside. He had to tell Jennifer never to do that again, or find a new assistant that would be a bit more discrete. Musk’s assistant continued, “I went through Mr. Musk’s meeting records for the past year, and there was no mention of Carter Brooks. I also couldn’t find any connection between Mr. Brooks and any of Mr. Musk’s companies. I’m sorry Mr. Eckhard. This may be a dead end.”</p>

<p>Before Cyr could reply, the door behind him opened and Elon Musk walked in the room. Cyr noticed that as soon as he saw the investigator Musk straightened up and puffed out his chest a bit, as if to appear larger. He went up to his assistant and whispered something in her ear, then gave Cyr a long glance. He whispered something else, then suddenly stood up and turned to leave.</p>

<p>“Mr. Musk!” Cyr said quickly on a whim, “do you have any connection to Selkirk Sports?”</p>

<p>Musk froze, and for the space of a breath nobody in the room moved. Then Musk slowly turned to face Cyr. A grin was on his face. “I do enjoy pickleball,” Musk stated, the grin not quite reaching his eyes. Then he turned and left the room.</p>

<p>Cyr walked out of the factory a few minutes later feeling dejected. The trip had been an enormous waste of time. Musk’s assistant had given him a very polite runaround, and he had gotten no closer to understanding what Brooks had been doing in Los Angeles. Maybe, he thought, those files on the memory key were completely made up, and they just used a famous name out of convenience. But the look in Musk’s eyes when Cyr asked about Selkirk said otherwise.</p>

<p>“Call a cab,” Cyr said to his AI, but Musk’s assistant came forward and held her hand up to wait and Cyr canceled the order. “Why don’t you take one of our brand new self-driving Teslas?” she said. “No need to pay for a cab. Consider it an apology since we couldn’t give you anything useful to help with your investigation.” Cyr stopped and thought for a second. He had heard about the new Tesla self-driving AIs, and how they were supposed to accomplish with only a couple cameras what other AIs need laser rangefinders, ultrasound, and radar to do. To be honest, Cyr didn’t trust them; he’d rather his car have as many sensors as possible looking for ways not to crash. But a free ride was a free ride. He thanked the assistant and walked over to where she indicated, where a row of gold-tinted sedans sat in a row, their electric charging ports hooked up to a huge inverter with the red and white Tesla logo painted on the side. An attendant directed him towards the nearest car, unplugged the charging cable, and opened the door for him. As Cyr got into the backseat of the car he made eye contact with the attendant and felt a hint of recognition. The parking attendant, he realized, looked a lot like the man on the bridge yesterday, the man who was watching him at the LA river. Before he could say anything the door closed, the car started up with a subtle chime, and the silvery electric motors whisked him out of the parking lot towards the highway on-ramp.</p>

<p>The sight of the attendant disturbed him, causing his heart to race. It could be just a coincidence, or two people with similar looks, but Cyr’s gut told him that this was definitely the same person from the bridge. Why had a parking attendant at SpaceX been across town yesterday? Had Cyr been followed this whole time? There was something else that was strange, something bugging at the back of his mind about the man. He seemed more familiar, as if Cyr had seen him before the bridge. Cyr buckled his seatbelt tightly as the car accelerated onto the highway. Had he seen the man following him some other time, maybe at the bar last night? Cyr didn’t think so, but it still bothered him. Was the man a former client? Or a competing private investigator, hired by Musk to track him and make sure he didn’t get too close to something? Cyr knew most of the private detectives in the city, and this man definitely was not one of them. Maybe he was new, a police officer taking gigs off-duty. Had he seen him at the police station before…</p>

<p>Suddenly Cyr’s heart started to race, and he broke out in cold sweats. He knew where he had seen the man before. It was at the police station, but the man wasn’t an officer or another detective. No, the man from the bridge, the man who had let Cyr into this car and carefully closed the door behind him, was the same man from the video walking with Carter Brooks in West Hollywood the night he had been murdered.</p>

<p>Out of nowhere the Tesla started to accelerate wildly, weaving in and out of traffic. Cyr tried the door handles but they were locked. “Stop the car! Stop driving!” he yelled, but the car’s AI ignored him. It was headed for a highway interchange three levels tall, with the tallest road a hundred feet off the ground. If the car drove off the edge, Cyr knew, there was no possible way that he would survive. He unbuckled his seatbelt and jumped into the front seat. Luckily this was an older model that still had pedals and a steering wheel for manual control. Cyr slammed on the brakes, and for a second the car slowed and a wave of relief rushed through his body. But then the car sped back up and the brakes became unresponsive. The car’s AI must have disabled them. He looked around the car panicked and tried the door again, with no effect. Then he looked in front of him at the steering wheel, still turning back and forth as the car’s AI wove through traffic faster and faster as it raced towards the overpass. So the steering wheel was still connected, Cyr thought. He knew he only had one chance before the AI figured out his plan and disabled it as well. He buckled his seatbelt tightly and, as the car started onto the overpass ramp, quickly jerked the wheel to the left.</p>

<p>Instead of getting onto the overpass the car hit the barrier and flipped, landing upside down in the right-hand lane of the highway. Cyr’s head snapped forward and was met by the airbag, which exploded in his face, breaking his nose. Another car clipped the Tesla and it spun, slamming Cyr’s head against the window. Then the movement stopped. Cyr hung upside down, blood dripping from his forehead and clogging his nose, and smiled. Not today you fuckers, he thought. The car AI, apparently reverting back to its normal non-murderous programming, started calling emergency services. Cyr heard sirens in the distance as his vision faded to black.</p>

<p>Hours later, Cyr was back in the police station, holding an ice pack to his aching head as he sat in a fading synthetic leather chair in the lobby. He had been lucky, the paramedics at the scene told him. Brainwave scans and infrared laser blood flow measurements of his brain revealed only mild concussive symptoms and no internal bleeding. The rest of his body seemed relatively fine, though a deep purple bruise was already starting to form across his chest where the seatbelt had held him in. As for the broken nose, well, he had dealt with that before. The paramedics had wanted to transport him to the hospital immediately for observation, but he waved them off and instead ordered a robo-cab to the police station. With as much adrenaline as his body was pumping he felt an overwhelming urge to get there and tell his side of the story, and get the department’s help in taking down a conspiracy that had killed Brooks and had tried to kill him too.</p>

<p>By the time he arrived downtown, however, even he could see how flimsy the story seemed. There really wasn’t anything connecting it all together, he realized, and his attempted murder could be easily written off as an AI issue or malfunction. Still, he told the officers what happened, and they dutifully recorded it all and promised to follow up. But the constant glances at his head injury and concerned whispering made him suspect that, in their minds, he had just been hit pretty hard in the head and gotten a little confused. Still they kept their word, and he stuck around until the report from Tesla came back with the car’s telemetry. It was worse than he feared. Instead of showing an AI malfunction or a sensor failure or some other convenient excuse, the records showed that the car had been operating perfectly normally until Cyr had grabbed the wheel, making the accident officially his fault, from a legal perspective at least. Of course they could adjust the records, Cyr thought. How stupid would I have to be to think otherwise?</p>

<p>Cyr’s head was pounding, and he felt dizzy. Maybe he should have taken the paramedic’s advice and gone for more scans, he thought. Self-doubt started to creep in between the pain. Was he really chasing a conspiracy, or was this just a bunch of coincidences? Had there really been a murder last Saturday, or just a drunk closeted businessman who took a step in the wrong direction? Even the morning’s excitement started to feel fuzzy and immaterial. Maybe he had imagined the Tesla going too fast, he started thinking. Had he just become paranoid? Could he even trust his own thoughts? He could hear blood rushing through his ears with every heartbeat. The pain in his head kept throbbing, and he felt nauseous. The empty afternoon police station lobby started becoming blurry. Blackness started tugging at the edges of his vision. Maybe, he noticed himself thinking lethargically, I should take a break. Rest for a bit…</p>

<p>A cop laughed loudly and Cyr snapped up, suddenly alert. He couldn’t let himself fade out like that, he thought. He stumbled down the hall of the station until he found the coffee machine, took a coffee pod at random from the basket next to it and slammed it in. The machine beeped and started whirring as flash-heated water converted the dehydrated coffee and stabilizers into something vaguely palatable. A few seconds later the machine deposited its black liquid into the styrofoam cup below. Cyr took a long sip, relishing the burning pain on his tongue as a distraction from the pulsing in his head. The caffeine and warm liquid woke him up, and he felt himself getting more alert. He took out his portable electronic notebook, scanned his face to confirm identity, and started swiping through the crime scene images again. There has to be something to this, he thought. I can’t be going crazy. He had seen all the pictures before. The body of Carter Brooks, lying in the morning sun below a bridge over the LA river. A closer image rendered from the 3D scans showing his body half-submerged in the tiny stream, his left shoe thrown farther away up the cement embankment. A view of the body on the coroner’s table showing his injuries. And then a picture of Emily, tears in her eyes, taken in the police waiting room. She was looking directly at the camera, as if begging Cyr for help. His heart skipped a beat. He had to figure this out, he knew. There was no choice for him. But what to do when he had already run down all of the leads and gotten nowhere?</p>

<p>He shifted back and forth on his feet as he leaned on the counter. His feet had started to swell up a bit due to the trauma, making his shoes feel tight. Cyr put his tablet away and reached down to adjust them, stopping as a wave of dizziness hit and then faded. Then he stood back up. His shoes…he took the tablet back out and swiped away from the picture of Emily to the crime scene photo. Why was the shoe so far away from the body? Heart racing again, he walked with a forced calm down the hall to the elevator, then took it down to the coroner’s office. After a brief conversation the coroner led him in and opened the locker containing Carter Brooks’ body, now naked under a thin sheet. At Cyr’s request the coroner opened the locker next to the body that contained his effects. Cyr rustled through it and found the plastic bag containing Brooks’ shoes. The right shoe was soaked and waterlogged, the synthetic leather peeling away from the sole. The left shoe was completely dry. Cyr asked for a moment alone, then took the shoes out and put them on the cold steel table. He turned the left shoe over looking for some sort of marking, something to distinguish it from the other, but found nothing. For a second he felt vaguely silly again, as if he was chasing at shadows. Then, a new thought occurred. He donned a pair of nitrile gloves and delicately reached into the shoe and removed the insole. As he did, his eyes grew wide and his heart started to race. At the same time, a wave of relief rushed through his body. Because under the insole, barely visible, lay a micro-sized electronic memory card.</p>

<p>The next morning Cyr stepped out of the self-driving taxi and walked purposefully towards the Palantir Global office. The protesters were still there, a group of about thirty people holding hand-painted signs and chanting about fascism. Cyr walked up to the leader, who was directing the crowd through a handheld electronic speaker, and whispered something in his ear. While he was doing that he slipped a small black envelope from the inside of his coat pocket and carefully palmed it to the protest leader. Not careful enough, however, to avoid being detected and classified as suspicious activity by multiple Palantir security cameras dotting the outside of their office.</p>

<p>Leaving the protest, Cyr pushed open the Palantir office door and marched up to the receptionist. “I need to see the man I talked to two days ago,” Cyr said, not bothering to introduce himself. “It’s urgent.”</p>

<p>The receptionist’s eyes twitched back and forth as he read text projected onto the insides of his glasses. “I’m afraid he is busy, Mr. Eckhard,” he said, “but if you’d like to make an appointment for later this week…”</p>

<p>Cyr slammed his fist on the counter. “I need to seem him NOW!” he yelled, startling the receptionist. “Tell him that if I don’t see him in the next hour there will be some very, very bad things about Palantir made public.” The receptionist looked up at him with startled eyes, lost for words.</p>

<p>The glass door to the back of the office opened and the Palantir VP poked his head through. “Mr. Eckhard,” he said with enforced calm. “Generally it’s polite to make an appointment. Please, come in.” Cyr smiled internally and followed the VP to the back office.</p>

<p>They went down a different hall this time, away from the open glass rooms of the shared workspace and into a dark hallway with cameras on each corner and secure keypads on every door. The VP stopped at one, scanned his thumbprint and face on the electronic lock, and then led Cyr inside. It was a small conference room, with three people sitting around a rectangular table. Everyone at the table had the same middle management look as the VP, and all seemed to be in a state of frazzled stress. Standing behind them was the man that murdered Carter Brooks, the man who had tried to murder Cyr the day before. A chill went down Cyr’s spine at the sight of him, but he kept his composure and walked to the small table, taking a seat directly opposite the other men.</p>

<p>“Mr. Eckhard, you’ve caused us a lot of trouble over the last couple of days,” the VP started. “Our company has no connection to Mr. Carter Brooks, but it seems like you’ve developed some sort of fixation with us. I’m afraid we’ll have to resort to legal action if you keep harassing Palantir employees.” In the corner, the man who had killed Brooks smirked.</p>

<p>“You can drop the bullshit now,” Cyr responded. “You might have tried to cover up what you were doing, but Brooks left a little something behind. I know that you had him killed. And I also know why.” Cyr pulled out his tablet, scanned his face to unlock, and then slid it across the table to the VP. He picked it up and started swiping, the amused look on his face slowly turning to a look of fear as he saw what Carter Brooks had left for Cyr to find.</p>

<p>“It was clever,” Cyr continued, “to test your new artificial intelligence software on something inconsequential first. Manipulating public opinion is always hard, but manipulating young people in the 20-35 year old demographic is impossible. Everyone knows that. You just can’t predict what kids will do next, what they’ll fixate on, what new trends will pop up that make absolutely no sense to old fucks like you and me. So when you set out to create a software that could manipulate the young people of an entire country against their own self-interest you needed to make sure that it would work. And pickleball was a perfect test.”</p>

<p>The VP said nothing, so Cyr continued. “Nobody knew what pickleball was a few years ago. It was a game for elementary school kids! Anyone over the age of ten found it embarrassing. But your software managed to make it the most popular sport in America in record time. To convince millions of people that it was cool, that it was fun. I’m sure Mr. Brooks’ bosses were thrilled that their sales went up ten thousand percent. But I doubt he ever told them what the next target for your software was. You can change what people want with a single click. With a presidential election around the corner…that’s a lot of power. I’m sure you’re hoping that your software will work.”</p>

<p>“Of course it works,” muttered one of the men sitting at the table, but a glance from the VP silenced him. “The one thing I don’t understand,” Cyr said, “is why involve Elon Musk? You know that guy can’t shut up about anything. Wouldn’t there be a risk of this getting out?”</p>

<p>“We needed his servers,” the VP finally said. “He dedicated almost half of his Memphis server farm to this program. And he’s arrogant enough to think that the software can’t manipulate him just as easily as it does anyone else.”</p>

<p>“I see,” responded Cyr. “So what’s the plan then? Sell the election to the highest bidder? Guarantee an extra five percent of the vote in exchange for a couple billion dollars in bullshit government contracts?”</p>

<p>At that the VP smirked. “This is about the continued preservation of America,” he said, “about staying the dominant superpower in the world. About making society secure for you and everyone around you. You wouldn’t understand. All you give a shit about is yourself. And unfortunately, for the good of everyone, we need to ensure that none of what you know becomes public.” The assassin in the corner stepped forward. “You really shouldn’t have come here,” the VP said. “We’ve been scanning all electromagnetic radiation around you since you walked in the building. No listening devices, no transmitters. You even left your AI interface behind. Besides this tablet there’s no record of this meeting ever happening.”</p>

<p>Cyr leaned back in his chair and smiled. “You’re right,” he said, “I don’t give a shit about anyone but myself. But I do have a vested interest in not ending up like poor Mr. Brooks. That’s why I gave a copy of all of these files to a number of people, including the protest leader outside. Don’t worry though, it’s all encrypted. But if I don’t come out of here within the next hour the password is automatically sent out to all of them. So you now have a vested interest in keeping me alive too.”</p>

<p>“What do you want.” The VP stated flatly.</p>

<p>“I want to get the hell out of here,” Cyr responded. “Something tells me that America won’t be quite as fun to live in as it has been, and it’s about time that I retire. Costa Rica seems like a nice place. But I want to make sure I have plenty of cash for mimosas. Fifty bitcoin should do the trick.” Cyr reached into his pocket and pulled out a small rectangular slab with rounded edges. “Put the bitcoin in this cold wallet, I leave this country forever, and as long as I’m alive you never need to worry about that password coming out.”</p>

<p>The VP stared for a bit, then turned to the others at the table and had a quick, whispered conversation. The assassin continued to stare at Cyr, now with a barely-contained look of disgust. Cyr stared back, pretending to be unfazed. Soon the Palantir team turned back to Cyr, and the VP reached out and took the cold wallet. He took his portable computer terminal from his pocket and set it on top, creating an inductive link between the two. A few quick voice commands to the terminal, and the encrypted keys for fifty bitcoin, untraceable by any government, flowed across the link and into Cyr’s electronic wallet. That kind of money, Cyr knew, would get him a lot more than just some mimosas. He could live like a king for fifty years. His hands shook slightly as he took back his wallet and put it in his pocket.</p>

<p>“Now get out.” Said the VP. “Gladly,” responded Cyr. “And in a month or so I’ll be gone from this country for good. But remember, if anything happens to me…” he didn’t finish his sentence, but the look of anger on the VPs face told Cyr that he had made his point. He got up from the table and let himself out of the conference room.</p>

<p>Once outside the building, he stopped for a second and shook as the adrenaline washed through him. Then, quickly and without looking to either side, he strode off. He passed the protest leader, who looked at him confused, then took a second look inside the envelope that Cyr had given to him an hour earlier. Just as before, it was completely empty.</p>

<p>A month later, Cyr sat inside a small restaurant overlooking the ocean. He cut into a piece of salmon, savoring the flavor as he slowly chewed. The synthetic stuff never quite matched the flavor and texture of the real thing, Cyr thought. But he had to admit that this synth salmon came pretty damn close.</p>

<p>The door to the café opened and Cyr saw Emily Brooks come in. She looked around for a second, then saw Cyr and headed towards him. “Mr. Eckhard,” she started.</p>

<p>“Please,” he said quickly, “call me Cyr. And thank you for meeting up. I know it has to be hard for you, coming to Los Angeles like this.”</p>

<p>She smiled. “Not too hard,” she said. “Idaho in January isn’t always the most fun place to be.”</p>

<p>They looked for a moment out of the café at the warm, sunny Los Angeles beach in front of them. Children rode by on electric scooters, and shirtless bodybuilders full of synthetic growth hormones passed volleyballs back and forth. In the distance, electronic music played. It was a peaceful scene, and at some level Cyr would be sad to leave it.</p>

<p>“Emily,” he finally said, “I wanted to apologize for not doing more for your husband. I’m retiring and moving out of the country tomorrow, and his was my last case. Unfortunately I couldn’t find out anything more than the police already knew.”</p>

<p>Emily’s eyes watered, but she blinked them quickly and looked away. “Thank you for trying,” she said.</p>

<p>“Your husband was a good man,” Cyr started, “he always tried to do what he believed was right…” Cyr stopped, tongue tied, realizing how little he really knew of this man, or of his widow in front of him. Come away with me, he almost said to her. Come to Costa Rica, forget about all this pain, let’s just enjoy life for a while. The thought was tempting, though he knew he had no right to even bring that up and cause her even more pain. Plus, that was not why he had asked her here.</p>

<p>Cyr suddenly stood up and gave Emily a hug, startling her. “Good luck,” he whispered to her. And, being extremely careful so that no security cameras could catch it, he slipped an envelope into her pocket. Inside was a small memory key.</p>

<p>Without saying anything more, Cyr ended the embrace, grabbed his coat, and walked outside into the warm Los Angeles winter. Emily remained standing, confused, a shocked look on her face. She felt in her pocket at the envelope. Behind her in the restaurant a commercial break ended and the national news started playing. “Reality television star Donald Trump, who was elected President in a surprise landslide election driven mostly by young previously left-leaning voters, has taken office today,” the reporter was saying. “He has appointed Elon Musk as his top advisor in a move that some judicial experts say may not be constitutional. As his first official act, President Trump has just grounded all international flights in and out of the country indefinitely, saying that this will prevent drug smuggling and illegal immigration. Bad news if anyone had a vacation lined up. For more on this story we turn to our Washington correspondent…”</p>
