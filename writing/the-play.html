        <p>The Play</p>

<p>I met Ryan my first month living in Los Angeles. I had moved to the city for grad school, far away from the small Texas town I grew up in and the even smaller Arkansas town that had been my home for college. I chose Los Angeles mostly for the beaches and the prospect of potentially losing my virginity to a hot actress, but also because I wanted to experience a bit more of the world. I remember the pure joy I felt driving through Koreatown for the first time and seeing signs that were not written in English; it felt like I had finally made it to a real city. Unfortunately, I only knew one other person out of the 14 million people in the basin, a fellow engineering student from Arkansas named Whitney who had also come to the city to get a master’s degree. When she texted me and asked if I wanted to go to a comedy show with her, I didn’t hesitate before saying yes.</p>

<p>The comedy show was at a theater on Hollywood Boulevard, and my mind went to glamour and fame as I followed the recently-released google maps to the address I was given. To my disappointment, I only found trash and some homeless camps when I got to Hollywood, and the theater was so nondescript I walked by it two or three times before I realized it was an actual venue. The inside of the theater was tiny and smelled like mold, and when the improv performance started I went from anticipation to confusion to boredom at how completely un-funny the cast was.</p>

<p>Except for one person, the youngest boy in the group, looking like he was barely out of high school. His jokes landed, his energy was infectious, he seemed both confident and nervous in a way that was endearing. Somehow, when he was on stage he elevated the people around him almost to the level of funny. I assumed that this was a star in the making. This was my very first time seeing aspiring actors perform in LA, and my first time meeting Ryan.</p>

<p>After the show was over I went up to Ryan and introduced myself, told him truthfully that he had been hilarious and that I had enjoyed his skits the most. He was excited to meet a fan, and we spent almost twenty minutes chatting. It turned out that he really was fresh out of high school, at that time a sophomore in a local college’s acting program. When my friend was ready to leave, he asked if we could exchange contact info. I, excited to make a second friend in the city and completely naïve to the intricacies of city relationships, gave him my phone number and then turned around to leave. “I like you. You have a very blue aura,” were his parting words to me, which at the time I felt only a bit strange about. But, when looking for new friends beggars can’t be choosers. I made a mental note to hit him up after a week to grab a drink and then left the theater.</p>

<p>I had barely gotten home, however, before Ryan messaged me. Because of my aura, he said, he knew that he could trust me, and there were some things that he needed to say that only I could hear. Over the next several hours he proceeded to send me a small novel over messaging, about how his older brother physically abused him, his dad had abandoned him, his cat Rosebud was sick and dying and he didn’t know what he would do without her (being new to “the industry”, I didn’t recognize the reference until years later). He was suffering, he needed a confidant, and he knew I was a good person and could help him. At the time I was deeply religious, and the beautiful women of USC had only just started to shake my faith in the evangelical Christianity of my youth. I was determined to help save this suffering soul, if not through religion than through giving him the love and support that was clearly missing in his life. And thus began our very strange friendship.</p>

<p>As it turns out, Ryan was a compulsive liar. I should say right now that to this day I have no idea if Ryan even has any brothers. I do know he has multiple cats, and I am pretty sure as soon as one Rosebud dies another one immediately takes its place. As for his father, I gathered that he was a high-up engineer at JPL whom Ryan still lived with, notwithstanding his attested abandonment. Him pouring his heart out to me was a creative writing exercise for him, and it took me a while to realized how little he said was based in reality. But his demonstrated lack of morals just made me more determined to demonstrate to him what a good role model and friend could be. Over the next couple years we spent a lot of time together, arguing about God (he often compared the christian god to a father who raped his children, much to my dismay) and discussing life. At one point, I helped him overcome his anxiety by going on a hike near his home, which despite being only a block away he had never thought to go on. Another time, he showed me the thousand plus page manifesto he had written to start a religion he named after himself, which would once and for all prove all the other religions of the world as evil and establish world peace and prosperity. It seemed none of his classmates wanted to join his church, though, and after a few months he quietly abandoned the project. I went to several of his plays, and continued to be impressed by his acting abilities. I also got to see an original one-act that he wrote, which was pretty good, with a darkly ironic theme. Often, when we hung out Ryan would spend the whole time ranting about how horrible and evil every other person in his life was, and then look at me with craziness in his eyes and compel me to agree with him, or at least not disagree. Despite how strange he was, I came to really value his friendship for one reason. Los Angeles can be a very shallow and almost passive-aggressive place, where people do not usually reveal their true selves and conversations must always support whatever idea is currently in vogue. Stating your belief in the “wrong” opinion, or even just not supporting the “right” opinion strongly enough, can be grounds for offense followed by passive-aggressive ostracization. Coming from a family and culture that prided debate, I hated this. With Ryan, though, I found someone who could never be offended and who would never break our friendship no matter what opinion I held, as long as I accepted him for his own crazy opinions and thoughts. We would debate back and forth about some of the controversial topics of the day, and he never disengaged, never put on a mask or pulled back emotionally, and was always ready to intellectually spar for as long as I had the energy. This was a rare gift for me to have in a friend, and one I did not take for granted.</p>

<p>There is one other thing you should know about Ryan before we get to the play, one that you may have already guessed. Ryan, when I met him, was apparently heterosexual, and would occasionaly force me to listen to his sexual escapades that were obviously fabricated out of thin air and his horny imagination. These included having sex with the owner of an airbnb he stayed at, “banging” every cute girl in his college class, and at one point graphically and vividly describing a dick pic he had taken the night before. Then, one day, the message that I probably should have seen coming a mile away suddenly appeared in on my phone.</p>

<p>“Alex, I think I'm bisexual,” messaged Ryan.</p>

<p>“That’s great, I’m glad you figured that out!” I messaged back. I really was happy for him, and hoped that this might be a sort of cathartic moment that would let him explore more of his subconcious and come to a better understanding of his place in the world. I also hoped the gay community in Los Angeles might welcome its newest member and give him a bit of the family he obviously craved, and I could step back a bit from my older brother role.</p>

<p>“So,” responded Ryan, “can I come over and suck your dick?”</p>

<p>A lot of guys have offered to suck my dick since I moved to LA. Almost all the time, I’m insanely flattered by the consideration, and they are to a rule polite and understanding when I tell them I’m straight. But with Ryan, I just sighed. “Ryan, I’m flattered but you can’t suck my dick,” I messaged back.</p>

<p>“Why not?” He countered with. “It’s not like you have to suck a dick. There’s nothing gay about it. It’ll feel good. I’m really good at it, I’ve sucked a lot of dicks and every guy says that I’m the best they’ve ever had. I’ve sucked straight guy’s dicks before too, and they all had a good time. Pleeeeeease????”</p>

<p>Besides the obvious lie of having come out of the closet five minutes before and claiming to be the best dick sucker that Los Angeles had ever seen, he didn’t seem to understand that pleading and arguing was not going to change my sexuality. Over the next several weeks he would hit me up, pleading with me to let him suck my dick (in a strictly non-gay way of course). Inwardly, I was getting fed up with him completely, though outwardly I kept my calm and just explained that no, I’m not ok doing sexual things with another guy, no, it’s not just that I’m repressed, yes, I understand you wouldn’t have an issue with it because you’re bi but I’m not bi! Eventually he stopped straight up asking, resorting to dropping hints and making innuendos that I charitably ignored. To his credit, while he often offered to send me his dick pics, he never actually sent me any after I said no. He probably realized that this would be a bridge too far.</p>

<p>So, now on to the play. One day, after a couple months of not seeing each other, Ryan asked if I would grab a drink with him. We went to a smokey bar across the street from where he had performed his last play, on the decidedly non-glamorous Hollywood Boulevard. The bar had low lights and circular booths with red velvet seats. It was the type of place that looks intriguing on screen, where you would expect to see famous actors and actresses relaxing over cigarettes, or maybe producers shaking hands over their latest slimy deal. In reality, the bar felt stale and musty, was almost completely empty on a Friday night, and the drinks were terrible. Ryan obviously loved it. We sat and talked about life for a bit, him in a better mood than I had seen him in a while, and then he finally got to the subject he had been waiting for.</p>

<p>“Alex,”, he said, “I wrote a new play and got it accepted to the Hollywood Fringe Festival. I’ll be directing and already have the lead actors lined up, but I need some background actors. Will you be in my play?”</p>

<p>I was pleasantly surprised. The last time I had acted was as the narrator of our eighth grade production of Into the Woods, but living in LA makes anyone curious about the entertainment world, and I saw the opportunity for a fun story to tell the folks back in Texas.</p>

<p>“I’m in!” I said. “As long as you don’t need any sort of acting skills, I’d love to be in your play.”</p>

<p>Then I thought for a second. “Wait, what part am I playing?” I asked.</p>

<p>“You’ll be a background cat,” he answered.</p>

<p>I felt relief in my heart. That sounds like exactly the type of play Ryan would write.</p>

<p>“You will have to wear cat ears,” he cautioned.</p>

<p>“Hell yeah, I’m going to be the best background cat ever,” I said excitedly, imagining how fun and silly this would be but also determined to perform well in my big Hollywood debut.</p>

<p>“And,” Ryan continued, “You’ll be naked.”</p>

<p>Oh.</p>

<p>Of course.</p>

<p>This was Ryan after all.</p>

<p>I immediately said no, he started whining and begging me, I countered with another offer, and after some intense negotiation I finally put my foot down. “I’m willing to wear a speedo on set, but I absolutely will not do it naked,” I said. The truth was, I’ve never had much of a problem with nudity and would have been open to doing a naked scene if it wasn’t Mr Please-Let-Me-Suck-Your-Dick that was asking. But I half-thought that there really was no play and he just wanted to trick me in to doing some “private rehearsals” at his house. I left the bar that night thinking that I wouldn’t hear anything about the play again, but a few days later Ryan called me.</p>

<p>“So nobody else agreed to be naked either besides the lead actor,” Ryan said. “Still open to being a background cat in a speedo?”</p>

<p>So I officially joined the cast.</p>

<p>It turned out that Ryan was still working on the final draft of the script, but he promised to send it out to the whole cast at least a week before the first rehearsal. I was curious to see what the story actually was, though now that I wouldn’t have to be completely objectified by Ryan I was getting more and more excited to be a part of an actually play in Hollywood. And after researching the Hollywood Fringe Fest, I realized that it was a real festival that would have real industry people there to watch and judge. When I finally received the script, I opened the file immediately and started reading.</p>

<p>The longer I read, the more my heart sank.</p>

<p>The script was the most fucked up thing I had ever read. At its core was an incest fantasy, with the main character an obvious self-insert for Ryan himself and a bunch of meta-bullshit layed on top, some of which was copied verbatim from that first set of messages Ryan had sent me years before about his family to try and manipulate me into friendship. The gist of the story was that a young man (totally not Ryan) had a cat named Rosebud (of course) who was very sick, and a mother who was in a coma (I never actually heard much about Ryan’s mother....maybe this was a true event as well). The main character had a beautiful, badly-written girlfriend who loved him unconditionally and an older brother who was mean to him and just didn’t understand him. Secretly, though, the main character had vibrant fantasies of having sex with both his brother and his girlfriend at the same time; he wrote a play about these fantasies, and (yes this was actually in the story) masturbated constantly onto the play he wrote, covering it with cum. One day, his cat dies, and he has a psychotic break, and starts seeing his brother and girlfriend as cats dancing around him, either letting him live out his sexual fantasies in his own fantasy world or else rejecting him and choosing to both abandon him to be with each other. I won’t go into details about how it ends, but safe to say the brother and girlfriend find the cum-covered play, an argument with some surprisingly good dialog ensues, his comatose mother comes to his fantasies to give him some advice, and then him, his brother, and his girlfriend act through his fantasy together (luckily not as explicitly as I’m sure Ryan wanted) in order to “cure” the main character of his delusions. What I read was masturbatory, both literally and metaphorically, with Ryan obviously using this opportunity to fulful his voyeuristic tendancies and force us all into his childhood trauma to boot. I almost quit the play as soon as I read it. But, I reasoned, I’m just a background cat. And it could make for a funny story. I decided to show up to the first rehearsal, and if I got a creepy or too sexually charged vibe from the rest of the cast I would quit.</p>

<p>Strangely, when I showed up to the first rehearsal the rest of the cast seemed normal. I quickly became friends with them, and while Ryan was strutting around like a short little Napoleon trying to direct us we joked and got to know each other. The main cast, also, was very talented, and I got an opportunity to see real acting up close for the first time. I decided to stick it out. The second rehearsal, however, there were a few less people. It seemed that the script was just a bit too much for some of Ryan’s classmates. Ryan came over to me as we were setting up.</p>

<p>“So Alex, I guess a few of the other cats can’t do the show anymore,” he said, “so we have to change roles. You're the Alpha Cat now.” Not only did I get a field promotion, but I would now be the cat-like personification of Ryan’s older brother in the fantasy sequences, which involved both ballroom dancing with the beautiful female alpha cat as well as some very sexual sequences with the main character while the actor was completely naked. I’m sure this was the role that Ryan had always dreamed of for me, and I suspected he might have pulled a fast one to get the previous Alpha Cat to quit. I had a horrible vision of Ryan staring and jacking off to me while we performed (which luckily never happened, he was very professional while on set). But, I had committed to being there, and I’m not the type of person that breaks their word. Still, for a good Christian boy from Texas I was now very far outside my comfort zone.</p>

<p>The day of the first performance arrives. I was still bad at ballroom dance. Ryan handmade somewhat risque cat masks for all the cat actors and bought us all new skimpy swimsuits. We changed backstage, shivering and making jokes to alleviate the awkwardness. A handful of people trickled in, leaving the theater still mostly empty. None of Ryan’s family were there. I wondered if he had even told them the play existed.</p>

<p>The lights go down, the first actors go on stage, and the play begins. Still backstage for the first half of the play, us cats were giggling and having a great time not taking anything seriously, much to Ryan’s annoyance. When it was my turn to go on stage I’m happy to report that I fulfilled my role well and acted completely professionally, conducting both a passable waltz and a coquettish interpretive dance in front of an actual audience. I found, thankfully, that cuddling and caressing a naked man was a lot easier when it was all for a play and I had a mask on, though I refused to watch the video that Ryan convinced a friend to take. The most surprising thing, though, was the audience. I was full tunnel-vision professionalism while on stage, but while we were cracking up and making jokes at Ryan’s expense backstage we started hearing others giggling too. This turned into full-blown laughter by the halfway point, and by the end the audience was fully engrossed in what they thought was a hilarious dark comedy. For the finale, the older broth actor delivered, with extreme campiness, “I guess the only way for you to get over your fantasies is if we....act them out,” the small audience went wild with cheering. Meanwhile, Ryan was absolutely furious that those desipcable audience members didn’t understand his art and were laughing at his masterpiece. But we didn’t care. Everyone besides Ryan, the audience and cast alike, were having a great time.</p>

<p>For the rest two week run of the play we sold out every night. It was a full Tommy Wiseau moment; people would bring their friends and start cheering on character, booing and hissing at the right times, and laughing uncontrollably at lines that I know Ryan had written to be full of gravitas. During one performance someone yelled “yeah, fuck your brother!”, and the whole crowd cheered. The cast leaned into it too, with each performance getting a bit more campy and silly, though the real actors in the cast always kept their professionalism up and put on a good show. Ryan, for his part, got angrier and angrier, then depressed and downtrodden, but by the last performance begrudgingly muttered “yeah, I meant it to be a comedy the whole time”, as if we believed him. I ended up having a great time being a part of the play and kept in touch with several of the cast members. We didn’t end up winning the festival, but we did get a standing ovation a couple of times, which I think counts for just as much.</p>

<p>As for me and Ryan, we stayed friends for a couple more years, but after graduating college he began to get more bitter and angry at the world. Our conversations turned mean, and the levity and wit that he used to bring to debates went away. Eventually, he said some incredibly racist things to me about a Korean girl I was dating at the time, and I decided that enough was enough and dropped contact with him. He spent a couple of weeks pleading with me to be his friend again, and to this day will hit me up once a year or so asking to “just talk”, but I’m alright leaving that friendship in the past and moving on to a new stage in my life. But I do still follow him on social media. And although he never became a successful actor or playwrite, Ryan did find a new career path to pursue. He’s now a therapist.</p>
