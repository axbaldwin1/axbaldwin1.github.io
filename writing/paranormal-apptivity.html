        </header>

        <p>You’re waiting at the street corner, nervously glancing at your phone every thirty seconds for a message you know isn’t there. Nervous, as always, about a first date, but not looking forward to it really. More like steeling yourself for the inevitable disappointment that would follow, if not tonight then in a few days or weeks, when she finally got tired of him or decided that there were better men in this city. The last several years of dating had left you bitter about dating in general, and while you resisted the temptation to dive into the dark corners of the internet where lonely men fantasized about the wrong kinds of things, you had gradually started to look at the women you dated as almost enemies. Or at best rivals; a different type of human who wanted to possess you, and who you had to fight against to get any sort of happiness. None of this reached the level of consciousness of course. The only thing you noticed was that women seemed to have gotten worse and worse, and you had privately resigned yourself to the idea of living and dying alone. Yet you still went on dates, out of a sense of stubbornness if nothing else. The girl you were waiting to meet on an indistinguishable streetcorner in central Los Angeles had seemed sweet, mildly cute, and happy to meet for dinner after a few perfunctory messages. Oh well, you thought, if she doesn’t show I can go home watch a movie. And if she does, then maybe I’ll get laid before the whole thing explodes in my face.</p>

<p>After another ten minutes of awkward waiting you see a petite woman coming around the corner. It was the girl from the app, but she seemed different than you expected. The way she moved was light and rhythmic, as if she was floating rather than being constrained by gravity. And her eyes, though they looked no different than in her pictures, seemed more alluring in person, focusing in on you with an intensity that drew you to her before she even said her name. Your heart skipped a beat, but you pushed any emerging feelings down. Maybe you’re more lonely than you thought, you think to yourself, that just seeing a cute girl gets you all emotional. Not tonight though. Tonight is just a first date, and women will run away from you if you show too much of your feelings or act too interested.</p>

<p>You introduce yourself, say a few perfunctory phrases about work, being tired, looking forward to the coming weekend. Without noticing it you start talking more than you usually do, describing the week in more detail than you normally would. Maybe it’s her eyes, that just invite you to tell her what's on your mind. Or maybe it’s the way she seems to listen with her whole body whenever you say even the simplest small talk. She was the one to suggest this place to meet, “near her home” as she put it, and you ask if she knows where she wants to go for dinner. “Follow me,” she says, and starts walking down the street. You follow after her, taking a second to catch up.</p>

<p>She takes a turn, rounds a corner, ducks through a narrow alleyway between building that seem much taller in the alley than they did from the street, and finally you both emerge onto a small street lined with huge, ancient magnolia trees that almost blocked out the sky. Lights are strung between the trees, and they already glow brightly in the fading twilight. You’ve never seen this street before, but in a city like LA there’s always a new street with hip shops or nice restaurants waiting to be discovered. You smile, remembering one of the reasons you’ve stayed in this godforsaken city for so many years. There’s always something more to discover here. And this street in particular seemed very popular, with people crowding the sidewalk waiting to get into the many bars and restaurants in the area. The people are dressed slightly strangely as well; maybe over the last year or so you’ve lost touch with the fashion of the day. You hope you don’t stand out too much. You make a joke about being old to your date and she smiles, tells you that you fit right in. Instead of joking back (something dirty about “fitting in” most likely) you just smile and feel a warmth in your chest. She heads to one of the nearby restaurants, and you follow.</p>

<p>In the restaurant you skip the line and go right inside. Your date says a couple words to the host, a tall, thin man with eyes that seem a bit too wide for his face, and then takes you back to the patio where a table is waiting for you. You ask what kind of food they serve here; she laughs, a sound that reminds you of wind chimes, and says that she wants you to guess. You look and listen to the people around you, hearing that most of the conversation is in a language you don’t recognize. Indonesian maybe? Something southeast Asian at least, though with the occasional harsh syllable that’s more reminiscent of German. And something else that you can’t quite place. Some food comes without you ever ordering it, small plates with colors and smells that remind you more of middle eastern food but with a hint of Christmas spices. You try it, and the flavors explode in your mouth, each one both absolutely distinct and completely unidentifiable. Whatever type of cuisine this is, you think, you definitely need to try it again. You wonder if they do takeout. You’ll be sure to ask before you leave.</p>

<p>You lean forward to ask about the food, make an educated guess on the origin, and slip some stories of your recent trips in to try and impress your date. But something in her eyes stops you. She asks how you like the food, and you can only mutter “it’s good” with a silly smile on your face. Of course, you think, you’d start feeling anxious now. You wish you had a drink before coming out. She sees your awkwardness and reaches forward to touch her hand to your arm, and a flash of energy surges from her touch. Your whole body lights up, your hair stands on end, it’s like a surge of electricity or heat. It touches your throat and suddenly you can talk again. Looking into her eyes, you feel something in your heart break a bit, and the energy from her touch surges forward and causes a breach in the dam you’ve built around your heart. You start telling her the truth about your life recently, without even thinking about what this will mean for the date or if this will help you get in bed with her at some point, and without fear that she will leave you or be turned off by all the feelings. You talk about your drinking, how you only feel normal when you’ve had a few drinks before a social event. How after your last breakup you tried acid and had a panic attack that lasted for a week after seeing how meaningless you were in the universe. How you still felt bitter and cynical, and didn’t see the point of living much anymore but kept going because you didn’t know what else to do. She listens, asks questions, but doesn’t say much. But her eyes are bright, and as she stares deep into yours it compels you to pour your heart out. You don’t stop, pouring your heart out to a woman for the first time in years. And she just keeps looking at you with her eyes, somehow even bigger than they were before. You don’t need to impress me, they seem to say. You’re alright.</p>

<p>You find yourself tearing up. Embarrassed at first, you try to hide your tears. She reaches out and touches your arm again. Her skin feels warm, almost tingly. Like there’s a static charge in her. The touch breaks something inside your heart, and you cry unabashedly. It feels cathartic, as if all the tension and fear you’re holding in your heart for your whole life is streaming out of you. After a few minutes you stop crying and feel an amazing sense of peace. She touches your arm, where some tears have fallen, and then licks the tip of her finger. You reach up to wipe away the rest of your tears but your face is dry.</p>

<p>You both stand up at the same time and leave the bar. You realize you never asked about takeout, never found out what type of food it was. Never even payed. But for some reason it didn’t seem important. Outside, night had fallen, and even more people crowded the sidewalks and spilled into a street somehow empty of cars. A cool breeze blows past you, refreshing after a hot day, and you smell something like sandalwood smoke. It must be coming from one of the nearby bars. Despite nightfall the colors on the street seem brighter than before, and the lines sharper, as if every little detail and object possessed a deep meaning far beyond what it’s corporeal shape would suggest.  You feel a connection with the world around you, and a sense that you’re on the right path even if you don’t know where that path will lead. Thoughts of getting laid or future plans are completely gone from your mind. You are just here, in this night, on this street, surrounded by people who at second glance look just slightly different than anyone you’ve ever encountered before. But instead of threatening, you feel a sense of acceptance, almost amusement coming from them. A touch on your shoulder from your date pulls you out of your reverie, and you both duck into the nearest bar.</p>

<p>You’re in the bar. A drink is in your hands, even though you don’t remember buying anything. You drink it, feeling a delicious burn as it goes down, and it seems to make you feel more sober for some reason, as if you were drunk the whole time but are finally seeing things clearly. As if you were blind but now can see. The bar is full of pulsing music of an atonal genre you don’t recognize but that seems to fit the new rhythm in your mind. Your date is looking beautiful, and she goes out on the dance floor alone and starts to dance, somehow attracting the light as if it’s a halo without any noticeable change in the people around her. You watch for a second, then finish your drink and go to join her. Around you, people large and small, male and female and other, are dancing together in a pattern that defies recognition. Out of the corner of your eye you see people with tails, with horns, with extra limbs or eyes that seem a bit too big or small, on necks that seem just a little too long. You’ve been to some crazy places before, costume parties and bars that focus on the ridiculous and the expressive, but here the people seems more real than in the West Hollywood scene or at a drag show. More comfortable in these bodies that you are in your own. In one corner, a person dissolves into bubbles before re-forming in time with the music. In another, three people wind around each other, through each other, combining in almost infinite permutations of limbs and color. The room itself seems to change, sometimes looking like a dance floor, other times a forest with fires lit all around you, and others a weightless sphere with people dancing around you in all three dimensions as well as a few other directions that don’t seem to fit into your normal sense of space. And as you dance, somehow you notice these things and just accept them. The clarity you got on the street only increases. You are happy, you realize. You’re at peace.</p>

<p>As you dance with your date you notice that her face doesn’t exactly look like it did when you first met a few hours ago. Or had it been longer than that? Time doesn’t seem to be working in the way it usually does, and despite dancing for hours you don’t feel any fatigue. Still, she was the most beautiful creature you’d ever seen. You looked deep into her eyes, now even with yours even though you would have sworn she was much shorter than you when you first met. She leans in and gives you a kiss. The kiss is sweet, full of the electric feeling from when she first touched your arm,  and deep. You close your eyes, feeling a sense of vertigo that excites rather than scares. Everything is alright, you realize. You’re part of all of this. You can let go. You give in to the feeling, falling back into a warm black ocean of colors, meaning, sounds, and feelings.</p>

<p>You wake up as the sun hits the concrete next to your head. You’re lying on the sidewalk, wrinkly clothes and a vague smell of sandalwood surrounding you. The street looks familiar to last night, but the lights are gone, the trees are just sickly looking saplings, and half of the windows are boarded up. A car rushes by, the smell of exhaust making you cough. You feel around; your wallet is gone, but luckily you still have your phone. You think back about last night. The sense of peace is still in your heart, and the feel of her kiss can still be felt on your lips, like the waves of the ocean can be felt even after you’re ashore. You smile, and start for home.</p>
