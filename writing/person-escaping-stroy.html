        <p>You wake up to your whole building shaking and your ears ringing. Whatever happened you must have been asleep. An earthquake? Your brain foggy, you wonder what the hell is happening. But the building doesn’t seem to be collapsing around you so you drift in and out of sleep, only waking up properly a few hours later. You stumble out of your bed and into the bathroom to shower, but no water comes out of the tap when you turn it on. You try the kitchen but still nothing, so you sigh and open the fridge to grab a cup of cold brew coffee. The fridge light doesn’t seem to be working either, though everything inside is still cold. You wander into your living room as the strangeness of the morning starts to sink in. You notice that your plant, in front of the open window, seems to be burned to a crisp when it had been healthy the day before. With horror, you realize that a perfect outline of the plant had been burned into the wall behind it.</p>

<p>By mid-morning nothing had changed. There was no cell service, internet, or electricity. Instead of the expected sirens and shouting in the streets there was a creepy silence, and grey snowflakes started falling on an empty street. Around noon a strong wind picked up, blowing inland from the lake and pushing the snow and ash west. By noon, you decide that the risk of leaving outweighed the danger of staying. Hopefully the wind would keep the radiation away. You pack your small backpack with as much food and water bottles as you can find, knowing that it will last you a day or two at most, and leave the apartment for the first time. The stairs are thankfully clear, though cracks on the walls make you nervous. You make it to the street around the same time that others, having the same idea, start emerging from their highrises. Small groups start forming, huddled together more for comfort than for warmth. There is already a line outside of the grocery store next door that is getting longer by the minute. For now there is no violence, but once the shock wears off and the grocery store’s supplies run low you don’t count on empathy winning out over desperation. You turn the opposite way and head north.</p>

<p>By the time night falls you’ve made it to the start of the suburbs. Everywhere you go the situation is the same. People standing around in groups, burning tree branches and broken furniture in the shadows of buildings that all seem on the verge of collapse. You witness some violence around grocery stores as people fight for food, but for the most part people are still holding on to the rules of civilization. Once night falls people start retreating back into the buildings, maybe judging that the risk of building collapse is less than that of freezing to death at night. You take their hint and duck into what looks like an abandoned coffee shop already stripped of anything edible. A family is already inside, the mother and small child sleeping while the father and another child tended a small fire. The father looks at you with envy as you open your backpack and take a few bites of food but doesn’t approach you. After thinking it over for a bit, you approach them slowly and offer some frozen chicken which had been in your freezer; you were planning on saving it in the snow overnight, but a quick smell made you think that it might be better to eat it now. The father relaxed, and invited you over. Grabbing a grate off of the air conditioner you use it as a grill to cook the chicken, sharing it with the family, then curl up next to the fire and go to sleep.</p>

<p>The next morning, you leave the family and continue north. As much as you hope that they’re ok, you just don’t have enough food or water to share and you don’t want to cause conflict in a couple days when things run out. You keep walking, stopping at dusk to rest and starting again the next morning. The food runs out after the second day. You start going into abandoned homes to look for food but except for a couple of frozen meals you don’t find anything. Locals must have picked it over before they left. For water, you’ve started putting snow in bottles and warming them up inside your jacket as you walk. To stay warm at night you usually find a group of people with a fire and stay with them until the next morning. Sometimes they have food and you’re tempted to ask for some, but the fear of losing a source of warmth or getting hurt and not making it any farther stops you. Once you get out of the city you spend one day in the woods, huddled up under some pine branches before you decide that hypothermia might be a worse threat than the crowds. The next day you set out for the nearest highway.</p>

<p>On the highway you find a caravan of thousands of people all traveling north. Rumor is that there is food and safety once you reach the Canadian border, though nobody seems to know for sure. Every night the caravan stops and starts fires with whatever they can find. The smell of sweat and burning plastic clings to everyone. You don’t have any food left to trade, and the people around you seem hesitant to give up any from what they carry, but every night some people come around and hand out bits of bread, biscuits, or small bowls of oatmeal for everyone. You’re thankful to have something, even though it’s nowhere near enough to sustain the days of walking and you can tell that you’re slowly starving. At one point you become curious of where the food is coming from and start making your way up the line of people. You eventually get to the front, where you find a semi trailer full of food that’s being powered from siphoning off gas from each car as you go along the highway. The semi is being crewed by a group of a dozen or so men wielding baseball bats and crowbars; others with a similar look arrive periodically with food scavenged from small towns ahead of the main crowd. You notice that the people in charge look a lot better fed than the ones behind them. You ask about helping get food and are told in no uncertain terms to fuck off, which even in your weakened state gets your blood boiling. Your grumbling stomach agrees, and you hatch a plan. Later that night, you slowly creep around the side of the highway until you get ahead of the column and then move back towards the semi truck. You manage to get by a guard staring ahead in a daze, get inside the semi, and start stuffing your backpack full of anything you can find. You must have been making more noise than you realized though, because less than a minute later a couple of guards come inside and start walking toward you, crowbars raised. Trapped against the back of the semi, the only thing you can do is fight. You charge the guards, catching one of them unexpectedly and knocking them to the ground. The other one steps back and swings, and you feel a crunch and a sickening pain in your left arm. Without looking back you take off into the woods. Nobody follows.</p>

<p>Alone in the woods, and with a broken arm that quickly swells up and starts throbbing, you stagger north across a frozen wasteland. The food stolen from the semi truck sustains you and gives you more energy than you’ve felt in a week, but within a couple days you become feverish. You’re lucky, in a sense; the fever keeps you warm at night when you might have frozen to death otherwise. But you keep seeing things out of the corner of your eyes, shapes and movement that disappears as soon as you turn towards it. After a week alone you start to wonder if you’re even going the right direction. You put the rising sun on your right every morning to head north, but by noon sometimes you’re so delirious you can’t tell if you’ve been walking in circles or not. After ten days the stolen food runs out. After another five days the fever breaks and your head starts to clear. Your left arm is still useless, though, and thanks to your delirious walking you have no idea where you are. Ideas of foraging or hunting for food don’t seem to be working. If you don’t find some food soon, you realize, you really will starve to death. One day you smell a bit of smoke in the air; at first you’re not sure if it’s real, but as you continue north the smell starts to get stronger. You can’t tell if it’s the caravan, a burning building, or some sign of civilization, but at this point you don’t have any other options. You go towards the smoke, and after two days you emerge from the woods next to a highway. Ahead is a fence with a gate, military vehicles, and red cross tents set up with military people handing out food packets to the arriving migrants. A Canadian flag flies above the gate. You’re safe.</p>
